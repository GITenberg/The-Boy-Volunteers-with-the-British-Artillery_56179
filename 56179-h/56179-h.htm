<p>"It seemed to me as though I should never have
the courage to go back to the airplane service since
Lieutenant Guyon was killed," remarked Ralph,
as he and Alfred were convalescing in the American
Hospital, in Paris.</p>

<p>"That is the way I feel about it, too," replied
Alfred. "To think that he should have escaped
the terrific shower of bullets, while we were coming
down, to be killed by having the machine hit
the ground, the way it did, makes me feel so sad
that I sometimes wonder whether it is really so."</p>

<p>"I suppose the only thing we can do now is to go
home; and, still, that doesn't seem to be the right
thing, just now," replied Ralph.</p>

<p>"No; I am not in favor of that; suppose we go
to England,&mdash;anywhere, or anything except that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
which will remind us of poor Guyon," answered
Alfred, as he sat in the huge chair and slowly
nodded his head.</p>

<div class="tb">

</div>

<p>At the outbreak of the war Alfred and Ralph
were on the way from southern Germany to Antwerp
in an auto, accompanied by a Belgian chauffeur,
where they were pursued by the Germans
near the frontier. They escaped for a time, but
were afterwards arrested by the Germans and
finally liberated. On their way to Antwerp they
took part with the Belgians in resisting the advances
of the foe. Reaching Antwerp, they escaped
with the Belgian army, at the time the city
was besieged, and after some adventures, crossed
the northern part of Belgium and reached Dunkirk
on the Channel.</p>

<p>From that point, in the endeavor to reach Paris,
they had some stirring exploits, which tested their
metal on many occasions.</p>

<p>From the time they left Belgian territory it had
been their wish to join the aviation corps, and this
wish was gratified after they had left Paris and
made their way to the eastern part of France.
The corps to which they belonged was stationed at
Verdun, the most vigorous outpost of the fighting
line.</p>

<p>There they were constantly engaged during a
full year of most intrepid warfare. They owed
their success in joining the corps as actual combatants
to a peculiar incident. Before reaching
the Verdun camp they had met Lieutenant Guyon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
attached to the station at Bar-le-Duc, and with
him they made numerous flights, especially in the
work of testing machines. On one occasion the
lieutenant, who was the victim of a weak heart,
was attacked with the disease while aloft, and the
boys piloted the machine to earth in safety, notwithstanding
the excitement caused by the sudden
pitching of the machine. It was sufficient to
show that the boys were made of the right stuff,
and the officer appreciated their bravery.</p>

<p>Thereafter, the boys were his constant companions,
flying with him on many occasions and engaging
with him in some of the most brilliant
encounters in the air with German aviators. The
time came, however, when, after fighting three of
the swiftest and most notable German aeroplanes,
both of the boys were wounded. In the effort of
the lieutenant to bring the badly crippled machine
to earth, it was impossible to prevent the catastrophe
which followed. The lieutenant and one
of the boys were thrown from the machine, and
the officer died from the effect of internal injuries
within a week.</p>

<p>The wounds of the boys were severe, and they
were held at the base hospital for weeks before
their condition was such as to permit them to be
sent to the Paris Hospital. At the time of the
foregoing conversation they had been convalescing
for a month. The death of their friend was a
terrible blow to them, so severe that, as indicated
by their conversation, they did not feel like participating
in any more airship work.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose we shall always have a feeling that
there is nothing like flying," said Ralph, as he
mused over their experiences that evening.</p>

<p>"It is all right, and I hope to do a great deal of
flying after the war is over, but I suppose we
might as well make up our minds to give it up for
good at this time," replied Alfred.</p>

<p>It was really a relief that the final decision had
come, for the feeling of reverence was so strong
for their dead friend that it seemed as though
something would be wrong to go up in an airship
without him.</p>

<p>"When shall we start?" said Ralph the next
morning.</p>

<p>"As soon as they give us the discharge," replied
Alfred. "You know no one is permitted to leave
the hospital until the doctor gives his certificate."</p>

<p>A week thereafter they were informed by the
nurse that the doctor had prepared a certificate
to the effect that both were able to leave. In one
way this was very gratifying, but they could not
forget the tender care which had been bestowed on
them from the moment they became patients there.</p>

<p>The certificates were finally handed to them,
and, going to their rooms, they sadly packed up
the few things which had accumulated. As they
passed out and marched down between the rows
of cots, with the packages on their backs, every
patient greeted them. The history of the boys had
reached every one long before this time, so they
were not permitted to go without the usual wishes.</p>

<p>"Sorry to see you go, but glad you are good as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
ever!" "Give them fits this time;" "Send the
Boches my compliments," said another. "Where
are you bound for this time?" cried a voice, from
across the room. Every remark, in fact, indicating
that they were expected to return to the fighting
line.</p>

<p>The emotions awakened by the greetings and
the good wishes were too deep to dispel the idea.
They could not, in the presence of the enthusiastic
men all about them, say that they had enough of
the <i>fighting game</i>, as every one called it. It made
them feel as though something was wrong, and
as they neared the door they almost made a bound
for it.</p>

<p>As they walked down the steps, Ralph looked at
Alfred with a peculiar expression on his face. Alfred
turned away, but suddenly wheeled around.</p>

<p>"Well, are we going back?" he asked with startling
suddenness.</p>

<p>"I felt awfully sheepish; didn't you?" asked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"No; I felt like a coward. Now when I think
of it I don't remember of a single fellow who left
the hospital since we have been here who ever
suggested that he wasn't going back," replied Alfred.</p>

<p>"That's a fact; well, I'm going back, but not,
in the airship service," said Ralph. "No; I
couldn't do that; anything but flying."</p>

<p>"Hello!" cried a voice behind them. "Out for
good, are you? Well, sorry to lose you; we have
a very polite way of bidding our patients good-bye,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
and I suppose I shall have to spring it on
you."</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Hope you won't come back again," replied the
doctor, with a laugh.</p>

<p>The boys were really unprepared for mirth just
at this time, but they managed to assure the doctor
that his wishes were reciprocated.</p>

<p>"Which way now?" continued the doctor.</p>

<p>"We don't know," replied Alfred. "We are debating
what to do."</p>

<p>"You see," interrupted Ralph, "since Lieutenant
Guyon's death we are all broken up, and we
have been debating whether or not we can go back
into the service."</p>

<p>"Go back?" queried the doctor. "You don't
have to go back; you are still in the service. Were
you discharged by any one?" he asked, glancing
at them keenly.</p>

<p>"Why, no; we never thought of that," said Alfred,
looking at Ralph.</p>

<p>"We were just talking about going to England,"
explained Ralph.</p>

<p>"If you did you would be deserters," replied
the doctor with a smile.</p>

<p>"Well, I thought it was singular that when they
gave us the certificates they should give us these
slips," said Alfred, pulling out the document.</p>

<p>"Of course, you are still in the service, and that
is merely an order for the last month's pay."</p>

<p>"I know that, but they didn't say anything
about keeping on," said Ralph.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span></p>

<p>"They don't have to. You are in and the only
way to get out is to be invalided, or to get a discharge
in a regular way, and then you are free.
Of course, we know how you feel about the death
of your friend, and no one blames you for your
aversion to re-entering the aviation service; but
if you really want to get out, the matter can be
easily arranged by applying to the American Ambassador,
on the ground that you are Americans,
and are minors," said the doctor.</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other in silence, and
finally Ralph spoke: "I think it would be well to
do that; would you mind taking the steps for
us?"</p>

<p>"I certainly shall be glad to do so; you have
earned an honorable discharge, if any one has,"
said the doctor.</p>

<p>It thus turned out that three days after leaving
the hospital, they received a document at their
hotel from the American Embassy. On opening
it they found two documents, reciting that Alfred
Elton and Ralph Cottrell, native Americans, in the
aviation service, were entitled to honorable discharges.</p>

<p>Somehow the news was not enthusiastically received.
They glanced at each other for a few moments
in silence.</p>

<p>"Does that suit you?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Not in the least," said Alfred with a mournful
shake of the head. "I don't think the doctor
had any business to get us out of the service."</p>

<p>"But we told him that is what we wanted."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span></p>

<p>They walked down the rue Rivoli, passed
through the place de la Concorde, and reached the
Champs Elysees in a half daze. Soldiers were
moving hither and thither, vehicles of every description,
Red Cross vans, and even cavalry
squads were in the procession, but none of them
seemed to attract their attention, so completely
were they absorbed in the last episode of their
lives, and, besides, they had seen so many of the
trappings of war that a few more or less did not
seem to cause much of a ripple.</p>

<p>But as they slowly moved along the street they
stopped, as by a common impulse, to witness a
procession of machine guns mounted on smart little
autos, followed by two full batteries of field
guns. The artillery pieces were mounted on specially
made auto trucks, and trailing behind each
truck was the caisson.</p>

<p>"Now, that looks like business," said Ralph.
"It would have taken from eight to twelve horses
to pull the gun and ammunition around. Gee!
how soon those fellows could get into action and
pull out when the command is given!"</p>

<p>"That would suit me about as well as the flyers,
but I suppose we haven't an earthly chance to get
in on that," said Alfred ruefully.</p>

<p>"Why not? We can get there if we try hard
enough," responded Ralph.</p>

<p>Alfred, with his eyes intent on the fine display
before him, did not respond. The discharge, honorable
though it was, made a sore spot in the heart
of each.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span></p>

<p>The following morning they awoke earlier than
usual. The usual topic was again taken up and
discussed.</p>

<p>"Suppose we take a trip to the Artillerie
Ecole?" remarked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Where is it?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"I don't know, myself, but it is across the river,
somewhere. It was founded by the first Napoleon;
it was always his hobby," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know. It was he who said that God
was always on the side that had the heaviest artillery,"
responded Ralph.</p>

<p>"I don't think he would say so if he lived in the
present time," answered Alfred.</p>

<p>"Why not?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Why, he would have said 'With the most airplanes,'"
suggested Alfred.</p>

<p>Ralph laughed at the new idea. "Well, you
may be right. I think that if the Allies would put
more money and energy into flying machines and
less in big guns, there would be more likelihood
of success; but I don't suppose we ought to know
it all," said Ralph with a sarcastic grin.</p>

<p>When they arrived at the artillery school they
were still garbed in the uniforms indicating the
service in which they had been engaged. A kindly
professor, in the uniform of a colonel, received
them with smiles, and he questioned them about
their work, and to him they confided their wishes.</p>

<p>"You have been granted honorable discharges,
and it would not be prudent for me to make any
recommendations, however meritorious your services<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
might have been," he remarked. After some
reflection he continued:</p>

<p>"If you are really bent on going back and entering
the artillery branch, it would be well to apply
to the English officials. They are preparing a tremendous
organization in that direction."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Ralph. "We shall, probably,
act upon your suggestion."</p>

<p>Returning to the hotel the question was again
considered, and the decision formed to depart for
the British sector at once. That afternoon they
emerged from the hotel and wended their way to
the Gard du Nord, as the great northwest station
of Paris is known. There two tickets were purchased
for Amiens, a town eighty miles north, by
railway, as they considered they would be able,
probably, to get into contact with the British
forces at that point.</p>

<p>It was late in the morning when the train rolled
into the city, and seizing their haversacks, the
boys were quickly out of the train and ranged up
alongside the military restaurant, awaiting an opportunity
to be served. They were informed that
a movement of great importance was going on in
the sector directly east of that point, as was indicated
by the vast number of field pieces, which
were constantly being transported by motor and
lorry.</p>

<p>It was, really, the beginning of the combined
English and French drive in the Somme region, as
it is now known. A dapper little French sergeant,
who sat between them, volunteered much of the information,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
which they were eager to obtain, as to
the localities and disposition of the forces.</p>

<p>"My battery was detrained at Moreil yesterday,
and they will come north and cross the canal
about eight kilometers east of the city," he remarked,
in response to their questionings.</p>

<p>"That is the branch of the service we are
anxious to join," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"What? after having had a hand with the flyers?"
he asked, as he looked at them quizzically.</p>

<p>"Yes; our best friend was killed, and then the
doctor at the hospital was so much interested in
us as to get us discharged," responded Ralph.</p>

<p>"But the artillery is a tough place; you've got
to rough it and stand an awful lot of pounding.
Why, in the Champagne region, where we came
from at the time we made the five-mile sweep, we
went ahead so fast that the commissary couldn't
keep up with us, and we were in the fight at one
stretch for more than seventy hours, and with little
to eat at that."</p>

<p>That was said not in a boastful way, but merely
to impress on them the hard lot of an artilleryman.</p>

<p>"I suppose that is so," remarked Alfred. "But
that's what the infantry men say; and the air
pilots think they have a particularly tough time
of it, and even the Red Cross people are in danger
all the time; but that's to be expected."</p>

<p>"Oh, if you're bound to go, there will be plenty
to do, but the chances of getting in are pretty slim
unless by regular enlistment."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER II<br />
<span class="small">THE FIGHT IN DEVIL'S CUT</span></h2>
</div>

<p>One of the important canals in northern France
starts from the English Channel, near Abbeville,
and parallels the Somme river, passing through
Amiens, extending thence to Peronne, within the
German lines. It was an important artery for the
transportation of munitions and heavy ordnance
directly to the front.</p>

<p>When, two hours after the conversation related
in the last chapter, the sergeant hunted around for
means of conveyance to the section where his battery
was to reach the canal, the boys accompanied
him. Accommodations were finally secured on one
of the many vans which lined the highway, and before
noon the sergeant informed them that, as they
were approaching the great highway leading to
Corbie, he would have to bid them good-bye, as
that was the point designated for the battery to
ship on the canal.</p>

<p>The boys debated the question, whether to remain
or proceed to the front, and finally decided to
continue their journey. But before proceeding
two miles further the procession of loaded trucks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
halted, and the work of unloading began. They
had reached the last permanent depot near the
fighting line, but what to do now was the question.
They were no nearer the object of their desires
than when they left Paris.</p>

<p>"I wonder why they are loading up that truck?"
asked Ralph, as they glanced at several power machines
close by. "Those boxes are going to the
front, I am sure."</p>

<p>"Want any help!" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"That's always welcome," said one of the men.</p>

<p>"All right, then," said Alfred, "here goes.
Which boxes do you want first?"</p>

<p>They had already learned that there is nothing
so welcome in the busy front as willingness to
lend a hand. It is the open sesame to friendship
and advancement.</p>

<p>"Where are you bound?" asked Ralph, as they
marched to and fro.</p>

<p>"Right up to the front. These things must
reach the 14th battery before night," was the reply.</p>

<p>Each of these trucks carried two tons of provisions,
loads greatly in excess of the weights for
which they were built, but that was of no consequence.
The fighters must have something to eat,
whatever happened. When the last boxes were
piled up the boys remained on the truck, and the
driver, nodding at them pleasantly, threw in the
clutch and speeded out the road to the east.</p>

<p>"How long have you been at this business?"
asked Ralph.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span></p>

<p>"Three months," was the reply.</p>

<p>"How do you like the job?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"I like anything that will help the boys at the
front," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Is this your regular business?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Well, no, not exactly," he replied. "I didn't
have any regular business before the war, but
when it came along I went back into the army, and
I would be there now if the Boches hadn't permanently
lamed me; you see I can't quite get my
right leg to straighten out. But it's all right; we
saved France at the Marne, and I'd give the other
leg to give them another such a licking as they got
there."</p>

<p>"Let me relieve you," said Alfred after the
second hour.</p>

<p>"Why, yes; an offer like that would be acceptable,"
he replied, as he rose from his seat.</p>

<p>In all their conversation the man had the aspect
of a true gentleman, and he was certainly out of
his element, in that menial position. Later the
boys learned from the assistant on the truck that
Loree was the son of a nobleman, and after having
been invalided he insisted on taking his place in
the capacity where he might be most useful.</p>

<p>"Why, you would be surprised, just as I am
and have been ever since this war began, to find
how many of the young men of the noble families
of France are doing this kind of work, after they
have been rendered unfit for duty in the ranks,"
said their companion to Ralph, as they were seated
on the rear of the van.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p>"How often do you make these trips?" asked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Twice a day, if we can get across the Devil's
Cut without interruption," was the answer.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by the Devil's Cut?" asked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Well, we have a stretch of about two kilometers
that's like going through hell fire. The
Germans have had the range of that road for a
month. When we get through that we are all
right, and sometimes they let us pass without
shelling; but not often," was the answer.</p>

<p>An hour thereafter the driver moved along and
notified Alfred that it would be necessary for him
to take the wheel. "Now get on the left side of
the truck low down," he said to the boy.</p>

<p>Without asking why, he did so and was surprised
to see the assistant and Ralph hanging to a
narrow running board at the side.</p>

<p>"What's up?" shouted Alfred.</p>

<p>"We are near the Devil's Cut," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Well, we are in it now," said the assistant.
"Everything seems fairly quiet,&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Bang." Something exploded. The boys had
heard that sound before. It startled but did not
disconcert them.</p>

<p>"What! are we going right into the German
lines?" asked Alfred, as he glanced about.</p>

<p>"No," responded Ralph, "but we have a mile or
so of close work, and this is the way the Germans
have of welcoming us, as well,&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Crash,&mdash;&mdash;" came the second shell, followed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
by another, completely drowning the voice of the
assistant.</p>

<p>"They mean to get us this time, sure," said he
finally. "Some airship gave them the tip, as they
usually do. We must now make a run for it, I am
sure of that."</p>

<p>The words had hardly left his lips before it
seemed as though a dozen shells had burst simultaneously.
One of the missiles had struck the
load, or some of the flying pieces went through.
The truck stopped. The assistant was lying on
the ground motionless, and Ralph, although unhurt,
was beneath a heavy box, as Alfred picked
himself up and looked around.</p>

<p>He drew Ralph out and glanced at the assistant.
"Too bad!" said the driver, as he descended from
the van, and stooped down to examine his assistant.
"That fragment finished him. But we haven't
time to wait here. They have our range, and we
cannot help him now. Get in quickly; there is another
one coming, back there; two more,&mdash;oh! but
they'll make mince meat of those fellows."</p>

<p>Looking back the boys saw a half-dozen loaded
vans, all speeding up, and some of the men waving
their hats in frenzy of excitement.</p>

<p>"Hiding doesn't do much good, but stay down
at the side as long as you can," he shouted back.</p>

<p>Another explosion, this time most deafening,
and so near that it seemed the truck was thrown
to one side,&mdash;still on went the machine. Then
something peculiar happened. The van started
across the field toward the German lines.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span></p>

<p>"Something's wrong!" shouted Ralph. "I
wonder what the driver is up to now? We're off
the road."</p>

<p>Alfred drew himself up and Ralph saw him disappear
toward the front of the van. The latter
followed, and, as he gained the top of the load, he
noticed Alfred leaning over and grasping the
steering wheel. The van swerved around and
reached the road, after two of the loaded vehicles
passed them. No sooner had they regained the
road when they met a hail of shrapnel, this time
one of the shells striking full and fair beneath
the machine directly ahead.</p>

<p>Alfred had barely time to turn the machine to
avoid the wreckage made by the shot. It was not
such a time as to enable the men on one machine
to aid those who were so unfortunate as to be hit
by the missiles. The last series of explosions, unfortunately,
struck the driver of the first van to
pass them, as well as demolished the second.
Ralph saw the driver fall and the machine turn.
It described a circle.</p>

<p>Alfred looked back and put on the brake hard.
Ralph understood. He leaped from the truck, and
rushed across the intervening space, being fortunate
enough to seize a stanchion at the side of the
wild van as it dashed by. It was but a moment's
work to reach the chauffeur's seat. He waved his
cap to Alfred, whose car was now again on the
main road. They had now gone more than half
the distance across the Cut, and, looking back,
Ralph saw four machines intact and following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
them. One was completely demolished and the
load scattered; and another, evidently, had the
motive power out of commission.</p>

<p>But they were not yet out of the danger zone.
Alfred was now in the lead, and he had no idea
where to go or what roads to take, as they approached
several divergent roads. With shrapnel
flying all about, he halted and as Ralph came up he
drove alongside.</p>

<p>"What is the matter?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Nothing," answered Alfred. "Wait until the
other fellows come up. Some one must take the
lead."</p>

<p>The third machine drew alongside.</p>

<p>"Go on," said Ralph. "We don't know the
way."</p>

<p>"Nor do I," replied the driver.</p>

<p>"Has your driver recovered?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"No, I am afraid he is done for; he has an awful
cut across the head," answered Alfred. "But
come on; we can't wait to get information here."</p>

<p>Another machine appeared as the vans driven
by Alfred and Ralph were getting under way.</p>

<p>"This way! this way!" shouted a voice on the
fourth machine. "Down to the left; and don't
waste a minute if you don't want to be blown from
the face of the earth."</p>

<p>A cavalryman sped past, waving his carbine,
and rounded up Alfred. "Go back quickly; turn
to the left."</p>

<p>Ralph was caught in time; they rounded the
crest of a little hill, and then, for the first time,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
the rear batteries came into view, and a mile
beyond, rows of sheds appeared in sight.</p>

<p>"That is your place," shouted the man on horseback.
"Follow the row of trees to the right, but
don't cross the bridge."</p>

<p>The throttle was thrown on full speed, and, although
the roads were fearfully cut up, and great
holes appeared at every turn, which had to be
avoided, they never stopped the maddening race
until the first guard line was reached.</p>

<p>As they turned into the compound where a division
was quartered, a speedy motor car dashed
out, and, halting before Alfred's car, signaled for
him to stop.</p>

<p>"Did you all get through?" shouted an officer.</p>

<p>"We left two behind," said Alfred.</p>

<p>The officer sat down, gave a quick order, and
speeded away to go back into that scorching streak
of road called the Devil's Cut, to rescue those who
had fallen. This was a mere incident repeated
day by day, until two batteries of 75-millimeter
guns were placed in position, a week thereafter,
when that section of the road was made as safe as
any in France.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="small">THE 75-MILLIMETER GUNS</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The Director of the Commissary Department,
with his staff, was on hand to inspect the six van
loads, which drove into the space between the store
sheds. He stopped in front of the van occupied by
Ralph. The latter stood up and saluted.</p>

<p>"We had a hot time of it," said Ralph.</p>

<p>Without replying for a moment the officer
quickly glanced at Alfred in the following car, in
astonishment.</p>

<p>"How does it happen that you are in charge of
these vans?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We were aboard on the trip, and when the
drivers were hit we took their places," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Did you know what chances you were taking?"
he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, no," replied Ralph, "but that didn't
make any difference. We are used to taking
chances."</p>

<p>"You deserve great credit for the work. Orderly,
take the names of these young men, and assign
them quarters. Be at my office in an hour,"
he said.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span></p>

<p>"Thank you; we will be there," said Alfred.
"Where shall we take these vans?"</p>

<p>"The officer in charge of transportation will direct
you," was the reply.</p>

<p>After the loads had been disposed of and they
were walking toward the commandant's quarters,
Ralph said: "We seem to get into the service by
the back-door route right along."</p>

<p>"Why, do you think they will give us a job running
those vans?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Possibly so; but I don't want any of it in
mine. I'd like to join the artillery and smash the
life out of those fellows who are shelling Devil's
Cut," replied Ralph.</p>

<p>At the appointed time the boys entered the commandant's
office. The drivers of the different
vans were present, and all greeted the two boys
with considerable show of appreciation.</p>

<p>"How did it happen that you were on the goods
vans?" asked the officer.</p>

<p>"We were trying to get to the front, so we took
the opportunity to help them load up, and just
came along after we got through," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Where did you get your uniforms?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We wore these while we were in the service,"
replied Ralph, and, as the latter said this, he drew
out the discharge paper, and Alfred took pleasure
in doing likewise.</p>

<p>The officer glanced at the papers, nodded his
head approvingly, and said: "Those credentials
are certainly creditable to you. We admire Americans,
and assure you we have the utmost respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
for the American boy. Do you wish to enter the
service? We can use brave fellows like yourselves."</p>

<p>"We are trying to join the artillery," said
Ralph, "but we haven't succeeded so far in getting
a position."</p>

<p>"I am sorry I cannot be of any service to you
in that direction," responded the officer, "but I
can commend you to the commanding general, in
submitting my report."</p>

<p>On leaving the building they passed a group of
men, who, evidently, were discussing the incidents
of the afternoon, for, as they approached, some
of the men saluted them, and one of them held up
his hand to stop them.</p>

<p>"I am requested to say that Count Le Clery
wishes to see you," he said.</p>

<p>They looked at him in a bewildered way.
"Count Le Clery, who is he?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"You will find him in the hospital, ward 8," was
the reply.</p>

<p>"Does he want to see us now?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes; he is able to see you now," was the answer.</p>

<p>Entering the hospital they were directed to a
row of cots, patient C, 28. Before them was a man
with a bandaged head, and an arm stretched across
the bed, held straight with a splint.</p>

<p>"I don't suppose you recognize me?" said the
man.</p>

<p>Alfred looked closer and slowly shook his head.</p>

<p>"I am told that you and your friend piloted my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
car and another through that storm in Devil's
Cut," he said.</p>

<p>"Oh, I know you now," said Ralph. "Well, we
couldn't do anything else, could we?"</p>

<p>"Well, I want to thank you, and tell you that
you have made a friend who will never forget you.
I remember the conversation with you before we
had our little accident," he continued, addressing
Alfred. "We need young men of your stamp, and
I will keep you in mind and act as soon as I am
able to move about."</p>

<p>Incidents of this kind are always the subjects
of conversation among hospital internes. They
seem to crave excitement, and like to talk about
exceptional exploits. That the boys were volunteers
and Americans at that, lately in the aviation
corps, bearing honorable discharges for valuable
services rendered, was certainly worthy of comment.</p>

<p>It was with some surprise that they were directed
by the orderly to take possession of a tent,
and assigned to a mess made up of the clerks of
the warehouse. There they found several other
young men, and during the two weeks they remained,
were general favorites with every one in
the government employ.</p>

<p>Late in the evening, hearing an unusual bustle
outside, and the tooting of horns, they peered out,
and saw a dozen goods vans coming across the
compound. On investigation they learned that the
last supply vans had not been molested in the least,
but the first convoy to reach the field base the next<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
morning was literally shot to pieces, two of the
chauffeurs having been killed, several of the assistants
severely wounded, and three of the vans
completely demolished.</p>

<p>The supply station was less than a mile behind
the lines, but it was well concealed behind a bluff
on the western side of the little stream, and only
occasionally would a shell find its way to that section.
The precaution was taken by the commanding
officer, to keep a score of airplanes above and
near the camp and thus prevent the enemy from
locating the spot.</p>

<p>During the following day they visited the
trenches, not on account of the novelty, but more
a matter of curiosity. On returning they crossed
the stream and ascended an elevation, designated
as Hill 207, where they inspected the battery and
conversed with some of the gunners.</p>

<p>"The big Bobs are on the way," said the sergeant,
in speaking of the preparations that were
going on for the great drive.</p>

<p>"What do you mean by that?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Oh, that's the term we use for the 75's," he
replied.</p>

<p>"They are the fellows we must see," said Ralph,
as they walked down the hill.</p>

<p>"When did that fellow say the 75's would come
up?" asked Alfred the following morning.</p>

<p>"He said they were on the way now," answered
Ralph. "Suppose we ask the boys."</p>

<p>Every one had heard of the famous 14th, which
had done such terrible execution east of Marmelon.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span>
It was understood that they were to take
up position along the ridge west of Hill 209.</p>

<p>"Let's go over there at once," said Ralph.</p>

<p>It was a long tramp to the top, made doubly
tedious and difficult owing to the torn-up condition
of the earth. This entire section had been
shelled by the French for more than two weeks,
and now, in turn, the Germans were bombarding
the same region. It would be impossible to give
an adequate idea of the nature of the fields over
which they traveled. At every convenient spot
the light field batteries were stationed, and after
numerous inquiries the place selected for the
famous battery was located.</p>

<p>Before noon the great field pieces were being
transported in a long train through the narrow
valley south of the river, while airplanes were circling
around continually, a sure indication that
something unusual was happening in that particular
part of the front.</p>

<p>Below the hill to the west, and entirely out of
sight of the German observation posts, was a deep
ravine through which an emergency railroad had
been operated, and a great tractor was drawing
the guns headed for the depression.</p>

<p>"That's where they are going to land those
guns," said Ralph in excitement. "Look at the
men filing up along the ditch."</p>

<p>"Come on," shouted Alfred.</p>

<p>They rushed down the hill, and impatiently
awaited the arrival of the first section. The great
tractor paid no attention to the soft earth and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
the shell holes in its path. It rolled along serenely
like a thing of life.</p>

<p>"Just in time, boys!" called out a voice from
the ammunition van behind the gun.</p>

<p>"It's the sergeant," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"So it is," replied Ralph. "Do you want any
help!" he asked, as he rushed over and walked
alongside the heavy truck.</p>

<p>"Oh, there'll be plenty to do as soon as we unlimber,"
replied the sergeant.</p>

<p>"One, two, three, four, five, six. I suppose
they'll put them all along this hollow'?"</p>

<p>"What are they bringing that brush for?"
asked Ralph. "Look at those trucks filled with
trees."</p>

<p>"We're going to plant a grove here," said the
sergeant. "That will take some work."</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other. There would be
plenty to do. An officer, the commander of the
battery, rushed up in a motor car, and, in a business-like
manner ordered the spacing of the
guns, and the disposition of the racks which held
the ammunition. The racks are really pigeon
holes in a heavily built frame, each frame holding
a hundred of these shells. They are located about
ten feet from the gun so as to be within convenient
distance for supplying the ordnance after each
discharge.</p>

<p>The boys admired the wonderful mechanism,
and the sergeant was quick to notice their great
interest in the arrangement for rapidly manoeuvering
the piece.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>"That is the most remarkable weapon that the
war has produced," explained the sergeant, as he
dismounted. "The Germans have tried to imitate
it, but we are always just a little ahead of them,
and can fire three shots to every two that they will
get out of their best. Wait until tomorrow and
you will see some business with the fellows on the
other side."</p>

<p>"Good!" said Alfred. "We owe them a thing
or two for what they tried to do to us yesterday."</p>

<p>"What's that?" he asked.</p>

<p>"They shelled us all the way through Devil's
Cut, but we managed to bring out several of the
trucks," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Why, we heard of that down at the village this
morning," said the sergeant. "And you are
really the fellows that helped out our men? That
was fine! I must tell the captain about it."</p>

<p>He beckoned to the boys. They followed.</p>

<p>After the usual salute, the sergeant, addressing
an officer, said: "Do you remember the story we
heard at the village this morning about a couple
of young fellows who were brave enough to rescue
several vans at Devil's Cut yesterday? Here are
the boys who did the work."</p>

<p>"I am glad to know you. What! in the aviation
service?" he remarked, looking at their uniforms.</p>

<p>"But not now," said Ralph. "We are looking
for a chance to help out with the artillery."</p>

<p>The captain looked pleased at this quick introduction
of the subject on the part of the boys.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
Then, turning to the sergeant, he said: "The
chapparal, officer; they can help out in that direction."
Then, turning to the boys, he continued:
"I am afraid you will not have a very easy time
of it, for those vans will have to be unloaded and
the guns concealed before we commence business."</p>

<p>Then the boys understood. They saluted and
accompanied by the sergeant, mounted the first
vehicle, which had stopped in the rear of one of
the guns. Out came the brush and the poles.
Meanwhile, the gun in charge of the sergeant was
pushed back, while a squad of men began to level
the ground in the deep depression.</p>

<p>The gun was wheeled into position, and the
wheels underpinned with timbers curiously laid
together and tamped, making a solid foundation.
Then began the work of concealment, so that those
prized pieces of the French artillery would be
safe from the prying eyes of the German air fleet.</p>

<p>"Now, boys," said the sergeant, addressing the
special squad delegated for the building of the
chapparal, "plant several of the heavy poles with
the brushy tops on each side of the gun; then
stretch wires across and hang the small brush to
them. Be sure to distribute them irregularly, so
as to make it as natural as possible."</p>

<p>Shovels and picks were now employed feverishly
to dig the holes and plant the poles. The
wires were strung and the decorations added, not
only along and around the location of each gun,
but in the spaces between the pieces. The vans
came up continually with new burdens of boughs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
until the boys thought there would be no end to
this new species of arbor culture.</p>

<p>"Ralph, do you think we could spot this place
at a distance of five thousand feet in a swift Morane?"
asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"I should say not," replied Ralph, "but there is
one thing I should do if I had anything to say
about it."</p>

<p>"And what is that?" asked the captain, who
overheard the remark.</p>

<p>"I'd completely cover the breech of the gun and
the ammunition case," he answered.</p>

<p>"And why?" asked the captain, with a smile.</p>

<p>"Because the merest glimpse of shiny metal is
likely to be noticed when flying. I have seen that
many times when flying, and Lieutenant Guyon
always told us to watch for it," replied Ralph.</p>

<p>"You are right," answered the captain. "That
will be your work. Here, men, follow the instruction
of these boys as to the placing of the boughs."</p>

<p>The sergeant showed his pleasure at the order,
for he somehow felt himself to be sponsor for the
boys. "You've got the old man going," he whispered
to the boys.</p>

<p>"Shall I go to the next gun?" inquired Alfred,
addressing the captain.</p>

<p>"By all means; orderly, instruct the workers to
follow the direction of the young men," said the
captain.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="small">A LESSON IN OBSERVATION</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The strenuous work was completed before night
covered the scene. The flying machines had acted
as a screen, and the guns, now in position, were
effectually covered from the eyes of a prying foe.
As they were about to leave the captain said:</p>

<p>"For the present you may find room in the vans,
but tomorrow the regular quarters will be prepared
near the guns."</p>

<p>The steaming hot supper, which was brought up
in the kitchen vans, was relished as never before.
After the meal they sat around and talked over the
incidents of the day, and learned each other's histories,
for there is a comradeship in the field that
obtains nowhere else in any other occupation.</p>

<p>"And so you have been flying?" said the sergeant.
"That has always had a fascination for
me, but, strange as it may seem, I have never yet
been up in the air, although I have had many opportunities.
I have often wondered how things
look from a height of two kilometers."</p>

<p>"Well, the first time I went up I couldn't distinguish
a thing," said Ralph. "I could tell what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
trees were, and could make out rivers, and houses,
of course, but outside of that everything else
looked like a blurred picture."</p>

<p>"Couldn't you make out people walking, or
troops marching, and the like?" asked one of the
men.</p>

<p>"No, indeed," said Alfred. "Why, how big do
you suppose a man would look at a distance of five
thousand feet, when you are directly overhead?"</p>

<p>"I don't know," replied the sergeant, with an
inquiring look. "I don't suppose he could be seen
at all, unless he happened to be moving."</p>

<p>"Why, at that distance it would be impossible
to see the man, moving or not, for he would not
appear bigger to the eye than the end of the finest
wire," Ralph informed him.</p>

<p>"I remember when we made our first flights at
Bar-le-Duc, that the lieutenant asked us to give
him our impression as to the sizes of objects we
saw and to tell him what they were. When a fellow
is flying about the first thing he will notice is
a river, if there is one anywhere in the neighborhood,
and, of course, I saw a bridge. I couldn't
wait until we landed before I marked it down on a
piece of paper: 'A bridge; 200 feet long.' I
thought I'd get it long enough. We were then flying
about 5,000 feet above the earth. I saw the
lieutenant smile. At that height the bridge looked
about like a lead pencil held ten feet from the eye.
Well, when we landed, the lieutenant said: 'It was
a bridge, sure enough, but it happens to be seven
hundred feet long.'"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span></p>

<p>"That reminds me," observed Alfred, "that we
talked about several other things on that trip, and
it will show how poor the judgment is unless the
eye is well trained. Do you remember the drill
ground east of Fleury? Well, we were asked to
put down the number of men we could estimate in
each group, and I was particularly anxious to tell
the lieutenant how many men were in each of the
squares which were formed. Each block of men,
as they appeared to me, were about the size of a
domino. I felt sure there couldn't be more than
50 men, but the lieutenant said there were at least
two hundred."</p>

<p>"But that isn't the worst of it," rejoined Ralph.
"We knew they were soldiers, because they were
on the drill ground, but if that same number of
men had been in the open country, it would have
taken an expert to see them. I was fooled in that
way not long after the experience I was just telling
about, and, although the lieutenant pointed out the
marching men, I couldn't spot them until he told
me to watch for the glint of steel that would occasionally
flash out. Then I understood."</p>

<p>"I have heard it said that if every moving object,
it mattered not how big it might be, were
painted the same color as the earth and other surrounding
objects, aviators would not be able to
discover them; is that really so?" inquired the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered Ralph. "I think it's pretty
near the truth. Sometimes even the upturned face
of a man will attract attention, although the face<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
makes a mighty small speck, but I believe that
fellows who think they can see a man's face at a
distance of 5,000 feet, either use a field glass, or
the man below happened to be wearing eye glasses,
for they make fine reflectors for the airmen."</p>

<p>"But those who are flying get birds' eyes, after
a time," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"What is that?" asked the captain, who appeared
at the door. "Do you think a man's eyesight
grows keener by flying, after he is at it for a
time?"</p>

<p>"It seems so to me," answered Ralph.</p>

<p>The captain shook his head. "I think that is a
misapprehension. The eyesight does not become
sharper or more acute."</p>

<p>"Then how is it that I can now see things that
I could not notice when we first began to fly?"
asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Observation! observation, my boy! You can't
see one whit better today than you could the first
time you went aloft," said the captain. "The eye
is a very deceptive thing,&mdash;you laugh at the statement,&mdash;well,
I'm going to prove it. In everything
you see the judgment is not formed by what the
eye tells you, but by your knowledge, your habit of
observation and application growing out of previous
experiences."</p>

<p>"Pardon me, Captain. Do you mean to say that
the eye doesn't correctly tell you distance or size
or what the object really is?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"That's exactly what I mean," replied the captain.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, that's a new idea to me," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Suppose we examine that. I have an article
here,&mdash;a box, in my hand. Tell me, Ralph, how
large it is, what it is made of, and what it is used
for?" said the captain.</p>

<p>"Quite easy," replied the boy. "It is about two
inches long; is made of metal, of some kind, and is
used to hold matches."</p>

<p>"The answer needs examination. Now, tell me,
first, how you judged it to be two inches long," remarked
the captain.</p>

<p>"Why, I should easily judge that, because it
wasn't as big as your hand, and not even as long
as one of your fingers," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"In other words, you used my hand to measure
it by, or, if my hand hadn't been there you would
have guessed its size because you knew, approximately,
the size of match boxes; is that it?" asked
the captain.</p>

<p>"Yes," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Very well; how did you know it was of metal?"
was the next question.</p>

<p>There was a broad grin on the faces of all; that
was too easy; Ralph's face was all aglow as he answered:
"Because I know that all match boxes are
made of metal, and it looked like metal."</p>

<p>"You mean it was your previous knowledge;
that is a fair answer," replied the captain. "But
how did you know its uses?"</p>

<p>Ralph glanced about preparatory to making the
answer, and Alfred replied: "I should say because
I know that a box of that kind and of that size, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
I've seen hundreds of them, is used for holding
matches."</p>

<p>"Well answered. Now, let us sum up: the eye
told you that the box was about two inches long.
That is fairly accurate. You got the measurement
simply by comparison. If a box had been placed
within the range of your vision, so that there
would be absolutely nothing with which to compare
it, you could not have told by a mere observation
of the eye whether it was an inch or three
inches long," observed the captain.</p>

<p>"Do you mean I wouldn't have been able to tell
the size of a match safe?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"No; I didn't say match safe. I said if <i>a box</i>
had been exhibited before you. If I had asked
you the size of a match safe it wouldn't have been
necessary for me to exhibit it; your knowledge of
the general sizes of match safes would have enabled
you to answer me without even glancing at
it. Isn't that true?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"I see what you mean now," said Ralph. "It is
previous knowledge that aids the eye."</p>

<p>"That is the idea," said the captain. "Now,
proceed with the next question. Why did you say
it was made of metal?"</p>

<p>"Because I never saw a match safe that wasn't
made of some kind of metal," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Did the eye tell the truth?" said the captain,
taking out his knife and opening it. "You will see
it is made of <i>papier mache</i>, merely colored to look
like metal. The eye was a gay deceiver; don't
you think so?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span></p>

<p>This was too much for the men; there was a
sally of laughter in which the boys joined with
the greatest glee.</p>

<p>"But we are not through with this investigation.
We have been talking about a match safe. The
sergeant here is a very wise person, and has had
a fine education, so I am going to ask him whether
it looks like a match safe," said the captain.</p>

<p>"I should say so; that is about the only thing
that occurs to me," he answered.</p>

<p>"Are you relying on your eyes, or what?" asked
the captain.</p>

<p>"Well,&mdash;on my eyes and on my previous knowledge,"
answered the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Then you are doubly wrong," said the captain,
as he opened the lid, and exposed the interior of
the case filled with tablets. "It is not a match
safe; was never intended for one, and was never
used for that purpose. Have I proven my case?"</p>

<p>The company applauded the clever manner in
which the captain explained the subject.</p>

<p>"This leads me to say that the eye brings into
your range something which may be familiar, that
is, something of which you have seen before, and
you say you have seen thus and so; or, on the other
hand, you see something which is unknown, or
strange. It is at this point where the value of observation
is of service. If you cannot compare its
size with something you have knowledge of, or
have no gauge by which you can determine of what
it is made, and no means which will enable you to
judge of its use, or its purpose, you must depend<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
on your own judgment to decide what it can possibly
be. In course of time the man in an airship
becomes a thinker and a reasoner, and does not
depend so much on the eye, as upon a judgment
aside from that which the eye tells him. Do you
understand now what I mean when I say that the
eye does not grow more acute, but that the mind
becomes more active, and, through observation,
enables the aviator to judge more accurately as
time goes on."</p>

<p>The captain's argument was unanswerable. It
was a revelation to the boys, and, as the captain
was about to leave, Ralph said: "We thank you,
Captain, for the wonderful lesson you have taught
us. I am sure we shall never forget it, and I know
we shall profit by it."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER V<br />
<span class="small">THE CURTAIN OF FIRE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Before the morning sun had lighted up the
scene, they could hear the buzzing of airplanes
overhead. That was a sound so familiar to them
that they could, at times, distinguish even the
motors that were used on most of them.</p>

<p>"I'll bet that's a Morane," said Ralph, as they
rolled around over the blankets, preparatory to
getting up.</p>

<p>"They are out pretty early in the morning,"
said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Got to be out promptly before any of the
Boches are able to come over and take observations,"
said the sergeant, in the adjoining van.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; I had forgotten about that," replied
Alfred. "What time will the fireworks begin?"</p>

<p>"As soon as the observations are completed,"
replied the sergeant.</p>

<p>"Any particular set of fellows on the other side
you are going to wipe out?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"You bet! We're going to make Devil's Cut a
promenade for a health resort," replied the sergeant.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span></p>

<p>"Then I'm with you," said Alfred, springing
out of his bunk.</p>

<p>The ten machines in the air inspired the boys
as they glanced aloft. "I rather have a longing
to return to that business," said Alfred, pointing
upwardly.</p>

<p>Ralph walked away without replying.</p>

<p>Shovels and picks were again brought into use.
Some of the men made an observation of the bank
alongside of the guns, while others began to dig
into the hills. Others brought up short sections
of young trees, which were planted upright side by
side and placed across the top to form a sort of
roof or ceiling. The earth, as it was taken out,
was pitched up on top of the roof thus formed.
The holes were dug into the banks from six to
eight feet deep, and usually six feet wide. Each
of the shelters thus made room for four men.
Really, each was intended for eight men, but as
half of the men would be on duty, while the other
half would be at rest, it will be seen that much
space was economized.</p>

<p>The mess shelters were somewhat larger or
rather, longer, but not any deeper, and heavy posts
were set at intervals, to hold the roof and the
earth. As these places were on the rear side of
the steep bank they were protected from shot or
shell, however vigorous might be the bombardment,
but, of course, the guns were subject to be
hit by well-aimed shots.</p>

<p>The boys took keen delight in digging their
shelter and in carpeting the floor with the stray<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
leaves, which were found all about the gun emplacements
after the protecting boughs had been
put overhead. True, the easy chairs were not the
most comfortable, as they had to improvise the
furniture from the odd sticks and branches which
were obtainable. But this didn't matter. They
were going to have a taste of the work with a 75-millimeter
battery.</p>

<p>"That Nieuporte machine is making observations
now," said Alfred, "and the puff indicates
that they have located two of the batteries."</p>

<p>"Well done," said the captain. "Glad you can
read the signals so well. Take your station at No.
2; and you, Ralph, go to No. 4. Report to the
lieutenant there, and give him the benefit of your
observation."</p>

<p>It was a proud moment for the boys. They saluted
and stationed themselves as ordered.</p>

<p>There had not been one moment of silence during
the entire morning. The guns were constantly
booming, and sometimes there would be a rattle,
as though salvos of machine guns were brought
into action. Anti-airship guns were always flashing,
and high in the air white and gray puff balls
would announce the explosion of shells, trying to
feel out the positions of the airships.</p>

<p>"That was a German shrapnel," said Ralph,
"and the one this side a French high explosive."</p>

<p>"How do you know?" asked one of the men.</p>

<p>"By the color of the smoke," replied Ralph.
"There, did you see the two that came together,
one with very white smoke on the right; the other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
with a sort of gray, off to the left? That last one
was from a French gun."</p>

<p>"What's the matter with that Farman machine?"
said one of the gunners. "He acts
queerly."</p>

<p>"The wing must be shot off, or he wouldn't
spiral in that way," replied Ralph.</p>

<p>"He's coming down, but he has the machine in
control, I think," remarked one of the men.</p>

</div>


<p>"Yes; if he can keep it in that way, but he must
straighten out or he will never reach our lines,"
said Ralph.</p>

<p>"See if you can make out the trouble," said the
lieutenant, as he handed Ralph the glasses.</p>

<p>"The pilot is dead," said Ralph, after a quick
observation.</p>

<p>"Do you think so?" asked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Yes; he is lying over the side of the pit; see,
he is motionless; take a look for yourself," said
Ralph, as he handed the glasses back to the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"I am very sorry, as we were dependent on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
Dupuy for the day's work. Report to the captain."</p>

<p>Ralph quickly made his way to the station occupied
by the captain. "I am requested to report
to you that Dupuy has been injured or killed,
and that is his machine now coming down beyond
the lines," said Ralph.</p>

<p>The gun crew glanced in the direction indicated.
As the machine neared the earth two of the French
machines more venturesome than the rest flew
low, hoping, no doubt, that the wind would be sufficiently
strong to carry poor Dupuy into friendly
territory, but in this they were disappointed.</p>

<p>Almost immediately another Farman sailed
across the battery and signaled. As it did so the
order came from the captain, to the lieutenant in
charge of the three guns on the right. "Line up
with Farman D 63, range 4700 meters."</p>

<p>The men stood at attention, all eyes riveted on
the disappearing machine. Every second a voice
would call out: "27, 27 and a half, 28, 28 and a
half," and so on, and at each call the gun pointer
would turn a small wheel, and the gun muzzle of
the gun would move up a trifle. Soon a puff was
plainly visible below the airplane.</p>

<p>"Tirez!" shouted the officer, and instantly there
was a sharp, crashing roar. The aeroplane had,
in the meantime, made a turn, and a puff appeared
above the machine.</p>

<p>"Too high!" shouted the officer. Two more
puffs appeared. "Two degrees lower!" was the
next order.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span></p>

<p>The guns were reloaded before the foregoing orders
were completed. Bang! bang! bang! Again
another signal; still too far overhead. Another
adjustment, and another round. The flying machine
sent up a succession of puffs, and the lieutenant's
face glowed with pleasurable excitement,
as he shouted: "You have it. Give them forty
shots; then depress."</p>

<p>While this was going on the three other guns
were just as busy. The guns were pointed diagonally
across the river, where the hills in the distance
seemed to be constantly covered with a
smoke.</p>

<p>"I notice that they have lots of smoke over
there, so it is hard to tell where to fire," said Alfred,
as he stood alongside the captain.</p>

<p>"That is true," he answered. "Our guns use
smokeless powder, and that will aid us in concealing
our position. If we used the same powder
they use in shelling Devil's Cut, we wouldn't last
a day."</p>

<p>Alfred understood why so much care had been
taken to cover up the guns, for the Germans had
guns which would reach as far as the 75's, but the
question was how to locate the batteries. In this
particular the French were superior, as well as
in the ability to handle the guns rapidly and accurately,
for it must be admitted that the French
had easily taken the lead in the use of heavy ordnance.</p>

<p>It did not take long to fire forty shots. There
was only a short cessation after the prescribed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
number had been let loose. The Farman machine
came up close. It signaled.</p>

<p>"That battery has been put out of commission,"
said Alfred. The lieutenant nodded approvingly
and with a great show of pleasure.</p>

<p>"Two degrees to the left," shouted the lieutenant.</p>


<div class="figcenter">

  <div class="caption">
    <span class="small"><i>Peculiarities of Trajectories</i></span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>Crack! crack! bang! spoke out the pieces as before.
And now it seemed as though the whole hillside
shook with the resounding roar. Alfred and
Ralph, as well as the officers, were on a slight elevation,
which enabled them to look across the valleys,
but the gunners who were firing could not
see, because they were too far down behind the
crest.</p>

<p>The boys had been too busily engaged to notice
that all along that low range, of which they occupied
but a small part, the artillery had taken
up positions during the night, and that more than
two hundred guns were now commencing and with
frightful execution carrying out that most terrible
of all forms of modern artillery warfare, the barrage
fire.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span></p>

<p>"We heard about that before we left Verdun,"
said Ralph. "Is that what is going on now?" he
asked.</p>

<p>The captain nodded. "You will notice that the
guns are now pointed at an angle which will carry
the shell the farthest," he said.</p>

<p>"Is that the forty-five degree angle?" asked Alfred.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_057.jpg" alt="Trajectories" />
  <div class="caption">
    <span class="small"><i>Peculiarities of Trajectories</i></span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>"Yes; if we elevate the guns the trajectory will
be higher, but the shot will fall short of the maximum;
if the gun is depressed the shell will fall
nearer to the gun. After we have demolished
everything at long range, the forward end of the
gun is lowered and a certain number of shots fired,
each gun swinging around a little to the right and
to the left, so as to reach all the spaces between the
guns. Then the gun is depressed still more, and at
regular intervals this is repeated until every foot
of space from the longest range to the shortest in
front of us is searched out."</p>

<p>"But while the shots are coming closer and
closer to our front lines won't the Germans come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
up and occupy the spaces, just as before?" asked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"That is just what we want them to do," replied
the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Why so?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Because, at a given signal, the guns are again
raised at the highest angle, and the result is that
all who have ventured to come forward, are
trapped, and will be caught by the next sweep of
shots as they are brought forward," answered the
lieutenant.</p>

<p>For more than five hours this incessant stream
of shells continued without interruption. The men
at the guns were perspiring. The relief crews
were lying on the ground, some of them actually
sleeping. Occasionally the boys would see a squad
arise, spring forward and take their places, while
those who had been serving the guns would drop
back exhausted in the shelters.</p>

<p>An orderly rode up and handed the captain a
paper. He signaled the lieutenant. "They are
preparing for the charge," he said. "Come, come,
my men!"</p>

<p>They rushed down the hill, and stopped before
the telephone booth, which had been installed while
the first assault was being carried out in the forenoon.
The operator was dictating information to
an assistant.</p>

<p>"The batteries will commence close action at
two o'clock. Commanders will observe the strictest
care as the columns move forward. The curtain
of fire will be in advance of the first line at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
least two hundred meters. Scouts report heavy
columns of enemy on the road to Albert. All batteries
east of hill 60 must concentrate on the ridge
behind hill 307, until the skirmishers are near."</p>

<p>"Low depression!" ordered the captain, as he
glanced at his watch. The boys noticed that it was
now within ten minutes of two.</p>

<p>The excitement was intense. There were no
men in the shelters now. Those not on duty were
near the crest of the ridge, shading their eyes and
glancing across the smoking fields. Two minutes
passed. The captain then marched out, followed
by the officer and the boys. As they reached the
top of the hill the captain, watch in one hand,
raised a handkerchief with the other.</p>

<p>It did not seem possible that the din could increase,
but it now seemed to be intensified. Every
gun was so low that the shells barely missed the
crest of the hill as they passed over. Five minutes,&mdash;ten
minutes,&mdash;it seemed an age.</p>

<p>"Look at the men along the river," shouted
Ralph. "They are going forward,&mdash;they have
crossed the narrow field, and are running up the
hill. There is the second column. Why, they act
as though they were only having a practice drill."</p>

<p>No sooner had the first and second lines passed
from view, than the third columns were noticed,
and behind them the reserves.</p>

<p>"Where did they all come from?" asked Alfred.</p>




<hr />

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span class="small">A SHELLED BATTLEFIELD</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The one hundred and two guns, which the
French had massed in this sector, covered a line
equal to nearly a mile and a half in length, as they
were less than seventy feet apart. As each gun
was able to fire twenty shots a minute, they hurled
over one thousand high explosive shells from all
of the guns each minute.</p>

<p>This multiplied by sixty, to represent an hour,
and then by five to get the grand total, in point of
time, makes more than three hundred thousand
missiles distributed over an area of less than five
square miles. Imagine, if you can, what it would
mean to have ten of those terrific shrapnel shells
explode over every acre in that region. No wonder
that human flesh cannot stand that sort of
warfare.</p>

<p>Slowly the muzzles of the guns were raised
higher and higher. In the front, over that broad
field, although the sun was shining brightly, yet
there was a thick haze. Absolutely nothing could
now be seen but the densest smoke, and noises
were no longer distinguishable.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span></p>

<p>The boys rushed down to the telephone station.
The operator, streaming with perspiration, and
with a voice so hoarse that it was scarcely above
a whisper, was still taking the messages.</p>

<p>"The second line has just been taken. They are
rounding up a division beyond the hill. The traverses
beyond are filled with Germans, who have
not offered any resistance. Prisoners are coming
in by the thousands. The railroad has been
reached."</p>

<p>"Wonderful! wonderful!" shouted the lieutenant
in an ecstasy of joy. "I didn't expect that.
We have cut into them two miles, at least."</p>

<p>The operator held up his hand. "The main defenses
on the ridge have just been taken. The reserves
have been ordered up to handle the prisoners.
Four staff officers have been taken from
the tunnel shelters," he said.</p>

<p>Every one was in a delirium. Each felt that he
had contributed some share to the glorious victory.
It was a revelation of the power of the French gunnery,
and the wonderful co-operation of the infantry
in moving forward in the shelter of the
<i>curtain</i>, as it has been so aptly termed.</p>

<p>Gradually the deafening din ceased and appeared
to die away. One gun from each battery
still remained on duty, and fired at regular intervals.
With field glasses many things could now
be distinguished, the important one, and that
which most interested the boys, being the immense
number of troops moving to and fro and through
the fields so lately harrassed by their guns.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span></p>

<p>"Would you like to take a trip across that territory?"
asked the lieutenant, as the boys came up.</p>

<p>"Indeed, we would," replied Ralph.</p>

<p>"It is too late tonight, but we intend to make
an inspection tomorrow," he replied. "I promise
you shall go along."</p>

<p>At supper that night there did not seem to be
any extraordinary show of enthusiasm. Probably
every one had been surfeited with excitement.</p>

<p>"Don't you have a queer feeling in your ears?"
said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Well, my ears have been humming and buzzing
right along. It appears sometimes as though
the guns were still going. It seems unnatural to
have this quiet," remarked Ralph.</p>

<p>"You'll get over that after a few days of this,"
said a gunner. "It wasn't an exceptionally noisy
day, as we had only about a hundred guns on tap;
but over in the Champagne, when we cut a swath
of six kilometers, fifteen kilometers long, in two
days, we had over three hundred guns. That
meant some pounding."</p>

<p>At nine o'clock in the morning the boys were
ready for the trip over Dead Man's land, as the
region was termed. Four officers and a half dozen
of the gunners made up the party of observation.</p>

<p>As they marched down the hill the lieutenant
said: "This is not a trip to satisfy mere curiosity,
but to give us an idea of the nature and extent of
our work. In order to appreciate it we are compelled
to make an investigation before the traces
of our work disappear."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span></p>

<p>They had little difficulty in crossing the stream,
for hundreds of crafts were all about. The first
evidences of the galling fire did not appear until
they had gone a thousand feet from the stream,
where the first line trenches of the Germans zig-zagged
around the inclined surface of the fields.</p>

<p>"This may interest you," said the captain, as
he pointed to a section directly behind the main
trench. The scene was an excellent one, as it gave
them a clear view over a field covering about two
acres. Before the onslaught, it had been a field
of sod, level as a floor, and part of the green was
in front of a magnificent country home.</p>

<p>The house was a mass of ruins, of course, and
two of the outbuildings had been burned. It would
not be a misstatement to say that so close together
were the holes and the upturned pieces of sod that
it would have been possible for one to go over that
entire lawn stepping from hole to hole, without
touching the grass.</p>

<p>"That must be a tunnel," said Ralph, as he approached
an opening, which could be observed
from the ruins of the house.</p>

<p>Together the party moved over and entered the
covered way. His surmise was correct. It was a
timbered channel way, three feet wide, and high
enough to permit a tall man to walk erect in it.</p>

<p>Alfred peered in. As his eyes became accustomed
to the darkness, several objects were noticed
in the enlarged space.</p>

<p>"I suppose they have furniture here," remarked
Ralph. "Hello! what's this?"</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span></p>

<p>The captain came forward, and struck a light.
Three bodies of Germans were lying on the floor.
That was queer. A closer examination was made.
It was then discovered that in the sound chamber
were other bodies, more than a dozen, and most of
them officers, as the insignias on their uniforms indicated.</p>

<p>"They were, undoubtedly, brought here at the
beginning of the fight," said the lieutenant.
"They had no idea what they had to contend with
when we opened on them."</p>

<p>All hurried away from the place. A plowed field
at the rear of the house was crossed, their steps
being directed to the stumps of trees at the other
side of the field. In crossing this short stretch of
field more than fifty dead were found, all in such
positions as to indicate that there must have been
a panic in their ranks.</p>

<p>An infantry officer in the party, who had been
with the reserve the previous day, remarked:
"More than three hundred prisoners were taken
along the edge of this field where these trees stood.
In taking them back into our lines I had a conversation
with one of the officers. He said:</p>

<p>"'I cannot begin to describe the effect of the fire
when your shots reached the timber. We had our
traverses alongside these rows of trees, and it
seemed as though a hurricane was going through
and breaking off the limbs, leaves and branches,
and flinging them down on the men. But that was
not the worst of it. As long as we were in the traverses
we could get some shelter from the bursting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
shells; but it was impossible to get away from the
falling branches. The ditches didn't help us then,
and the men, despite all our efforts, rushed out,
preferring the bursting shells to the new terror.'"</p>

<p>"Did you ever see such kindling wood?" remarked
Ralph, as they picked their way through
the debris.</p>

<p>"But did you ever see such a fine collection of
metal?" replied Alfred, as he pointed at the pieces
of shells which were scattered on all sides, and in
every conceivable place.</p>

<p>One trench after the other was crossed. Without
exception all contained bodies of men, who
were stricken before they could get out, for the
men delegated had not yet been able to give the
dead proper burial. Various parties were at work,
performing the last rites to those who had fallen,
and they stopped before one party thus at work.</p>

<p>Several dozen men were engaged in carrying the
bodies to the trenches where they were laid side by
side close together. Not all were Germans, for
many Frenchmen lost their lives on that day.
When a sufficient number were gathered the officer
in charge of the party directed the assistant to examine
the remains of each.</p>

<p>The first quest was to determine the number tag,
usually attached to each soldier, and after this had
been entered in a book, a search was made to discover
letters, photos, money and souvenirs which
the pockets might contain. A note was made of all
these things, and, finally, the exact location of the
interment was added to the transcript, thus giving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
a reasonable assurance that the friends or relatives
might know with some degree of certainty the
burial place and also in time receive the effects
taken from the bodies of the fallen soldiers.</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a gruesome sight, not worse, perhaps,
than many others which belong to the battlefield.
In the heat of battle, when everything is
noise and bustle, and when men grit their teeth and
rush into every sort of danger, they become
numbed to scenes even worse than this. But it is
different when in the calm of the morning, they
see the results of their work and allow their
thoughts to wander.</p>

<p>The party had reached the base of the hill, and
was nearing the formidable fourth line of the German
trenches, which were taken at the last assault.
One company after the other of French infantry
was even then marching over the fields to take up
positions in the newly acquired territory. The
trenches were turned around facing the other way,
the shelters revised to meet the new conditions,
and the underground retreats properly cleaned
out.</p>

<p>"Did you ever see anything so awful as this?"
said Alfred with a shudder, as they gazed on the
great corpse-filled trench directly behind the crest
of the ridge.</p>

<p>"There must have been an infantry charge
here," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Quite right," said the infantry officer. "They
made the last stand here. It was really pitiful to
see them, as our infantry came up the hill. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
shells were exploding over them, not a hundred
meters ahead of our foremost columns. They
tried to fight, it must be said to their credit, but
they were crazed by the terror of that fire."</p>

<p>"How far are we from our battery?" asked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"I should say about three kilometers," said the
lieutenant.</p>

<p>"Just to think of it," responded Alfred, "about
two and a half miles distant, and see what happened
here."</p>

<p>It would be merely a repetition of the same
sights over and over to describe the scenes. Every
sort of accoutrement, guns, swords, knapsacks, articles
of food, clothing of every description,
kitchen utensils, and at one place a poor dog, horribly
mutilated, made up the scene and afforded a
gruesome picture.</p>

<p>"What is this?" said Alfred, as he stopped and
picked up an envelope. It was sealed, and had not,
evidently, reached the one for whom it was intended.</p>

<p>"What shall I do with it?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Turn it over to the searchers,&mdash;the ones who
are now burying the dead," replied the lieutenant.</p>

<p>Alfred marched across the open and handed it
to the officer. "I found this at the corner of the
field," he explained.</p>

<p>The officer acknowledged the receipt with a bow,
and held it up. "Lieutenant Johann Schroeder,
10th Infantry," the inscription read. "Have you
the name there?" he asked, looking at the clerk.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span></p>

<p>The latter examined the index. "Yes; here it is;
body in the tenth lateral, over to the left," so the
letter was deposited in a huge sack carried by two
assistants.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_068.jpg" alt="Shell" />
  <div class="caption">
    <span class="small"><i>The Deadly Shrapnel Shell</i></span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>But there were other objects which had to be
taken care of besides the bodies, as everything on
the battlefield that has a value is gathered up.
Metals are of great utility, leather can be used
over again, and so on through the whole list. Repairs
to roads were necessary and parties for this
purpose were also in evidence, as it was their business
to make this region habitable again for the
army which must occupy it.</p>

<p>Several large vans were now seen coming up
over what was once a roadway. It stopped at intervals
while the men carried the various articles
to them and others put them in place inside the vehicles.
The boys with their party were passing
a group of men thus engaged when a terrific explosion
took place.</p>

<p>The noise created by the unexpected calamity
attracted the attention of hundreds of soldiers and
officers, who rushed to the scene. The captain was
killed, and the lieutenant wounded. When Ralph
regained consciousness, he saw a half dozen men<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
lying on the ground, and finally recognized Alfred
among the number lying still.</p>

<p>An officer rushed up and shouted: "That makes
the second accident with unexploded shells.
Where is your commanding officer?" he inquired
of one of the workers.</p>

<p>"There!" said the man, as he pointed to the figure
of an officer who was lying in the unfortunate
group.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="small">A LIVELY CAMP BEHIND THE LINES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>Such accidents are of common occurrence on
the battlefields. However carefully the shells may
be made to insure their explosion at the instant for
which they are timed, something often happens
with many of them that prevents it.</p>

<p>Ralph was too dazed to have any feelings about
the matter, except the faintest idea that he ought
to do something to help his chum. It did not at
that time, nor for hours thereafter, seem to be
anything dreadful, nor did it occur to him that Alfred
might be dead.</p>

<p>After all he had seen during the day, this was
a mere matter-of-fact occurrence, something that
might happen to any one, particularly on a battlefield.</p>

<p>When he again recovered consciousness, he saw
a dim light close by his bedside, and noticed some
moving figures. Then he looked about and glanced
upward. The ceiling was white and clean, and a
woman with a neat white cap and gown stood beside
his bed, and smiled at him. This was, indeed,
strange. He couldn't have been hurt, for he felt
no pain.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you feel better now?" said a sweet voice.</p>

<p>That seemed to break the charm. "Why,&mdash;yes;
I am feeling well; but what has happened? Where
am I? and,&mdash;and&mdash;where's Alfred? Oh, yes; I
know now; something happened a little while ago.
Where is he?" said Ralph, as he tried to move.</p>

<p>"Alfred is across there; he is sleeping now. He
will be all right in a few weeks," said the nurse.</p>

<p>Ralph looked at her for a time without replying.
He seemed to be gathering his thoughts. He
raised up his arm, and noticed that it was bandaged.
He dropped it and glanced up at the nurse.
"We had an accident a few minutes ago, didn't
we?" he asked.</p>

<p>"That was two days ago," replied the nurse.
"But you are all right now. We were a little worried
at first, because it was impossible to tell just
where or how you were hurt; but now you'll get
well, so don't worry."</p>

<p>"Will Alfred, too?" he asked eagerly.</p>

<p>"He is mending rapidly, but his injuries are
more severe than yours. Every one here is so
anxious and inquires about you," remarked the
nurse.</p>

<p>"Why, who are looking out for us? Where are
we? What place is this?" he asked wonderingly.</p>

<p>"This is the town of Corbie, north of Amiens.
The lieutenant of your battery was badly shaken
up, but he is all right now and left this afternoon.
But you must be quiet; a hospital is a bad place to
be excited in," said the nurse.</p>

<p>"Yes, I know that. We have been in the hospital<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
before. This isn't the first time," said
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Ralph?" said a weak voice.</p>

<p>"That's Alfred, I know. And how are you?"
asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"All right. I thought you'd never wake up.
I'm all right now," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Now be quiet," said the nurse soothingly.
"The doctor says you must not do anything to
excite yourselves."</p>

<p>The night passed without incident. In the morning
Alfred's cot was moved over adjoining the
one on which Ralph lay.</p>

<p>"Now you can talk all you want to, but sleep
whenever you can," remarked the nurse, as they
were comfortably fixed.</p>

<p>"Say, Alfred, did you have any pain at all after
the thing went off?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Not the slightest bit; the first thing I knew I
found myself here all fixed up, and heard a band
playing outside," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"So they have a band here?" inquired Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes, indeed; and a dandy one, too; say, did
you have anything to eat yesterday?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"I don't know; and there's another thing I
know; I'm mighty hungry now. When did that
thing happen?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Day before yesterday; no, the day before
that," replied Alfred.</p>

<p>"Well, then, I don't think I've had anything to
eat since then. My, but I'm hungry," said Ralph.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span></p>

<p>"There she is; she's coming; look at that big
tray," said Alfred with glistening eyes.</p>

<p>"I thought you'd relish something about this
time," said the nurse as she deposited the tray on
the folding table and wheeled it near their cots.</p>

<p>"Well, I should guess so, after not having had
anything to eat for three days," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Why, you ate a fairly good meal yesterday
noon," replied the nurse.</p>

<p>"What? <i>I</i> did?" said Ralph, looking at Alfred
in an amused manner, and then at the nurse. He
shook his head, and continued: "Well, if you say
so it must be so; but I never knew it."</p>

<p>"No; of course, you didn't remember; well, we
see so many instances of this kind. It is really
strange," continued the nurse, "how men will forget
everything, not even know their names, and
still will not forget to eat. That seems to be a law
of nature,&mdash;the first law,&mdash;the one of self-preservation."</p>

<p>"Well, even if I did eat right along this tastes
as though I hadn't taken a meal for a month," said
Ralph.</p>

<p>There were many curious cases in the hospital,&mdash;forms
of disease developed by the war that were
novel even to the doctors.</p>

<p>Two weeks thereafter, when Ralph had entirely
recovered, and Alfred was able to go out for short
walks, they had many conversations with the doctor.</p>

<p>One day while returning from a jaunt they encountered
him, just as a patient was brought into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
the hospital, who was staring about and screaming
wildly.</p>

<p>"Is that a crazy man?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Not exactly," replied the doctor. "It is a peculiar
mania, however. We had several dozens of
cases the day after the great drive,&mdash;in fact, at the
very time you were brought here,&mdash;of Germans
who were brought in suffering from that ailment."</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"It has been called 'War Psychosis,'" answered
the doctor.</p>

<p>"What is the cause of it?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is brought about by the patient
being compelled to witness the most terrible
sights," answered the doctor. "It occurs where
the man has a peculiarly sensitive or nervous organization."</p>

<p>"A man like that cannot be very brave, I suppose,"
said Alfred.</p>

<p>"It is not that at all. Lack of bravery, or fear
has nothing to do with it. I have seen the strongest
men break down under it," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"Is it a fatal disease?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"No, it seems to leave them almost as suddenly
as they are affected by it. Do you see that tall man
over to the left&mdash;the one who is swinging his head
to and fro, and staring at those about him?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I have frequently watched him during the
week," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"He is a typical case," said the doctor. "He is
an Alsatian, and belonged to the first reserves.
He was a first-class shot, as well as a member of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
the battery when in the service. At the breaking
out of the war he joined the colors at once. His
battery was in the thickest of the fighting from
and after the Marne. He saw all the slaughter
about him, and at first became moody. His boon
companion was a neighbor's boy, Tony, who carried
the ammunition.</p>

<p>"One day a shell exploded near the battery and
poor Tony was killed. This did not seem to affect
him much, and he looked around listlessly
when they buried the boy. The next day another
shell exploded near him, tearing the captain to
pieces, and wounding three of his companions. Instantly
he leaped forward toward the enemy, and
had to be restrained and forcibly carried back of
the line, where he was taken charge of by the hospital
attendants. That happened less than a week
ago. We had to bind him hand and foot, but he is
better now, and will be all right again in another
week. There are thousands of such cases."</p>

<p>Some days hundreds of patients would be sent
away,&mdash;taken to Paris, or to some of the great hospitals,
where the best of care could be bestowed.
In fact, all cases which were expected to require
weeks to effect a cure, had to be sent to the base
hospitals, or the field hospitals would be overcrowded.</p>

<p>The boys were only too glad now to relinquish
their cots in the general ward and take a room in
the convalescent ward. From that place they
would wander out and watch the great processions
of soldiers as they passed on to the front.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span></p>

<p>"I wonder why it is that we don't see any
French soldiers around here lately?" remarked
Alfred.</p>

<p>"I was thinking about that very thing," said
Ralph. "We must inquire about that."</p>

<p>Inquiry developed the fact that the English had
been extending their lines, and now occupied the
front in that section down to the area over which
the French had made their last successful drive.</p>

<p>"Do you know where the 14th French battery
has gone?" asked Ralph of an attendant, when
they returned to the hospital.</p>

<p>"I really do not know, but I understand that
they are now near Noyen, or in that region," was
the reply.</p>

<p>A week thereafter the boys, now fully satisfied,
left the hospital, and, as the doctor handed them
their certificates of discharge, he remarked:</p>

<p>"The lieutenant sent your things to us the day
they left the ridge. The attendant will get them
for you."</p>

<p>They had entirely forgotten that they owned
anything. The two packages were found intact,
together with a note of regret from the lieutenant,
and from the men of the 14th battery. It was a
gratifying thing to receive, and greatly appreciated
by the boys.</p>

<p>On the road they walked along toward the reserve
camp two miles to the north, during which
they met numerous fellow pedestrians, of all sorts,
conditions and characteristics. Peddlers, hucksters,
dealers in all sorts of wares, tradesmen, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
few carpenters with their tools, going and coming,
and this over a road which in normal times would
not have a dozen visitors during the day. The
vast army to the east brought trade to many inhabitants.</p>

<p>They were particularly interested in a peddler,
who plied his trade with considerable energy. He
would push to the front whenever a troop of soldiers
appeared, offering his wares, and, after each
sale, or when he had completed his canvass of a
troop, would swing off his pack, take out the
money, and count it. Then, invariably, he would
draw out a pencil, note down something on the
wrapper in which the money was kept, shoulder his
pack, and march on.</p>

<p>"That fellow is the most particular man I ever
met," remarked Ralph. "I suppose he puts down
every sou he receives. He is what I would call a
tightwad."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not that, but just a trifle careful," responded
Alfred.</p>

<p>It was an amusing experience to the boys, as
they watched his procedure. It was always the
same and never varied. The camp was in sight,
and they left the road to visit it, but before entering
the grounds they sat down to rest, and while
there the peddler passed them.</p>

<p>The boys waited until a regiment of newly arrived
English entered the gateway, before they
rose and followed. The peddler was on hand the
moment the regiment halted, and obsequiously
passed down the line offering his wares. They noticed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
that although there were no purchasers,
nevertheless the peddler went through the same
formula of making a notation on the paper, which
was used as a wrapper for the money.</p>

<p>Parked at one side was an immense train of the
well-known English three-inch guns, the counterpart
of the French 75's which did such terrific execution
several weeks previous to this time, as heretofore
related.</p>

<p>"There are the flyers," said Ralph, as he
pointed to an open field to the east.</p>

<p>"Let's have a look at them," responded Alfred.</p>

<p>As they were crossing the ground, Alfred
stopped. "There is the old peddler again. He is
a diligent fellow, sure enough," he said.</p>

<p>Although there were only twenty machines on
the ground, they could see from the vans within
view that many more were awaiting the unpacking
process. Here, as elsewhere, the peddler appeared.</p>

<p>Ralph stopped and gazed at the man for a few
moments. "Alfred," he said, "somehow I don't
like that fellow's actions. What business has he
here if he is really a peddler?"</p>

<p>"That fellow's a spy, or there is something the
matter with him," replied Alfred. "Do you know
I have had my suspicions ever since the regiment
came in."</p>

<p>"Why?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"For this simple reason: did you observe that
he went through the entire regiment without making
a single sale?" asked Alfred.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I saw that," answered Ralph.</p>

<p>"Well, after he got through with them, he took
out his money just the same and made a note on
the paper," answered Alfred.</p>

<p>"That does look very strange," replied Ralph.
"He will bear watching."</p>

<p>"Suppose we follow him and see what he has
to sell?" suggested Alfred.</p>

<p>As they neared him the peddler had reached a
group of assistants and threw off the pack, displaying
a collection of wares, such as needles, pins,
handkerchiefs, and like articles of utility likely to
be used by soldiers and officers.</p>

<p>"That looks innocent enough," observed Ralph.</p>

<p>A sale was made, the change passed over, and
the inevitable paper package drawn out, followed
by a pencil, which was used, apparently, to note
the amount of the sale.</p>

<p>He was followed to the space where the artillery
was parked.</p>

<p>"That fellow may be all right, but he looks queer
to me," said Ralph. "Suppose we count the number
of guns here and their calibre."</p>

<p>Alfred paused, and looked at Ralph with a cynical
grin. "What for? Do you think he will carry
any of them away?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Never mind; let's count them," answered
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Then, why not count the airships, those in the
vans as well," returned Alfred, now smiling and
catching the meaning of this proposed investigation.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; go over at once; I will attend to the guns.
Meet me at the stand. I see he is going over in
that quarter," replied Ralph.</p>

<p>The latter took particular note of the Long 3's,
as they were known technically. There were
forty-two. Eight howitzers were under cover at
one end of the line, as well as three mounted,
heavy-calibre guns, which Ralph judged might be
at least eight-inch bore. He entered the sheet-iron
warehouse at the end of the field, as the peddler
emerged from it at a side door.</p>

<p>Within was stored an immense quantity of
trench equipments, a row of newly devised bomb-throwers
being conspicuously displayed at one end
of the warehouse. Ralph counted them. "There
are certainly more than a hundred; I may have
missed some of them," he remarked to himself.</p>

<p>As he marched across the open space to the
stand which had been selected as the meeting
place, he saw Alfred awaiting him. The latter
seemed to be greatly excited, and the moment
Ralph was sighted he ran over.</p>

<p>"Do you know who is at the hangar?" he said.</p>

<p>"No; I can't guess," answered Ralph.</p>

<p>"Joe; don't you remember Joe; the American
that we made our first flight with up at Dunkirk?
He is over at the hangar and wants to see you,"
said Alfred.</p>

<p>"All right; let's go over," replied Ralph. "But
did you count them?"</p>

<p>"No; but Joe gave me the information; eight
Sopwith tractors, ten Bristols, and six B. E.'s, all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
set up. Tomorrow they will unpack eight more
Sopwiths and six Bristols. That makes a total of
thirty-nine," was Alfred's answer.</p>

<p>"What do you think? That fellow was coming
out of the warehouse the minute I got there. Do
you suppose he thought there was any peddling
business over there?" said Ralph with some determination
in his voice.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span class="small">THE SPIES IN THE CAMP</span></h2>
</div>

<p>"By jing! I'm awfully glad to see you," said
Joe, as the boys appeared. "Excuse me for not
shaking with the right hand, but that is out of
commission, and the left is not much better. And
how have you been? Oh, I heard all about you.
Lieutenant Guyon! poor fellow! he was a brick;
sure enough. Too bad he had such a weak heart!
That's what did him up. Say, do you know when
we got the first reports we understood that both
of you went under; and say; did you ever get hold
of any of the New York papers that wrote you up?
Fine obituaries! Makes a fellow feel good to read
about yourself after you're dead. I have some
notices of the same kind about myself."</p>

<p>Ralph and Alfred laughed, as Joe rattled on.</p>

<p>"But tell me," he continued, "what have you
been doing the past six months?"</p>

<p>"Why, we've been in the artillery service," said
Ralph.</p>

<p>Joe arose and looked at them straight and hard,
as he replied:</p>

<p>"Artillery service? You don't mean it? And
where?" he asked.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span></p>

<p>"Directly east of Amiens. We just came out
of the hospital," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Out of the hospital? Were you in the big
drive? Wasn't that a dandy? So you got peppered
up there, eh?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Well, yes; we were in that from the first; but
they never touched us; we got hurt after the battle
was over; accidental bomb explosion on the battlefield,"
replied Ralph.</p>

<p>"Tell us about yourself," said Alfred. "How
did you happen to lose your right arm?"</p>

<p>"Tried to bring down too many of them in one
day, I suppose. Oh, they gave me a tough fight;
but they came down when I did."</p>

<p>"So you are not flying now?" remarked Alfred
with a rueful voice.</p>

<p>"No," said Joe, looking down and slowly shaking
his head. "I can do it as well as ever, but
they won't let me."</p>

<p>"See here, Joe; we've got something that's
bothering us; we believe we are on the trail of a
spy. He acts like it. It's a peddler. I followed
him around, and both of us noticed some suspicious-looking
things on his part," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"A peddler!" remarked Joe. "Why, I saw a
peddler around here a half hour ago. Fellows of
that kind need watching. Go on investigating. I
am awfully sorry I can't move around as I used
to, or I would help you out."</p>

<p>"What is the matter with your foot?" asked Alfred,
as he now saw a bandage above the ankle.</p>

<p>"Oh, that was only a part of the damage. Go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
on, boys; see the commandant; here, let me give
you a note; now, take it over to that low building
in front of the brown warehouse," said Joe.</p>

<p>"Thank you for the hint," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Don't forget to come back; I want to talk
with you," remarked Joe, as he waved his hand
in the parting salute.</p>

<p>The peddler was nowhere to be seen as they hurried
across the field. The boys were too much excited
to open and read the note which Joe had
given them.</p>

<p>"Is the commandant in?" asked Alfred, as they
approached the guard.</p>

<p>An orderly appeared, and to him Ralph handed
the note. It was at once taken into the officer's
room. The orderly came out smiling, bowed and
said:</p>

<p>"Col. Winston wishes you to step in."</p>

<p>They were met at the door by the officer, who
grasped their hands warmly as he said:</p>

<p>"You don't know how happy I am to meet you.
My brother always speaks so affectionately of you,
and my sister is really much hurt because you left
Dunkirk without seeing her."</p>

<p>The boys were astonished. Ralph was the first
to speak:</p>

<p>"Are you Lieutenant Winston's brother?"</p>

<p>"Did he recover from the fall in the airship?"
asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Yes, and he says that without you he would
have been crushed to death; we are certainly
thankful to you. And now, what can I do for you?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
Joe says you have something important to communicate
to me without delay," said the colonel,
glancing at the note.</p>

<p>"We may be mistaken," said Ralph, "but we
think we have spotted a spy."</p>

<p>"Where?" asked the colonel, as he arose from
the chair. "Here in the camp?"</p>

<p>"Yes, right here; over in the warehouse and at
the hangars, and he acted so suspiciously before
he reached the camp that we've been trailing him,"
said Alfred.</p>

<p>The colonel tapped a bell. The orderly appeared.
"Send for Captain Rose. Tell him it is
urgent," said the colonel.</p>

<p>"We ought to be out looking for the fellow, for
we missed him as we came across the grounds.
He's a peddler," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"The captain is out on duty and cannot be here
for a half hour, so he informs me over the wire,"
said the orderly.</p>

<p>"Then suppose I go out and tell Joe to watch
that end of the field, and from there I will go to
the entrance. Probably they,&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Wait one moment," said the colonel, interrupting,
as he turned to the orderly. "'Phone to the
corporal of the gate squad and ask whether a peddler
has passed out within the past half hour; if
not, tell him to arrest a peddler if he attempts to
go out."</p>

<p>"I will go over to the warehouse," said Alfred.
"I have an idea he is sneaking around in that part
of the grounds."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span></p>

<p>"Good idea," said the colonel. "Hand this to
the officer in charge," he said, as he sat down and
wrote a few lines on a pad, and handed it to Alfred.</p>

<p>The latter lost no time in presenting himself to
the officer in charge.</p>

<p>"Is this Lieutenant Brand?" asked Alfred, as
he addressed a trim-looking officer.</p>

<p>"Yes; at your service," was the reply. He
looked at the note.</p>

<p>"What is this?" he continued.</p>

<p>"A spy, we think," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Do you mean he has been here?" said the officer
in an incredulous tone.</p>

<p>"Yes; not more than a half hour ago," answered
Alfred, "and he is here somewhere on the
grounds; we are trying to find him."</p>

<p>"One moment; there is a call on the 'phone; excuse
me," said the lieutenant, as he disappeared
into the next room.</p>

<p>"Yes, he is here!" Alfred heard the lieutenant
say. "Do you want him?"</p>

<p>Alfred was moving toward the door when the
lieutenant appeared and announced: "They have
arrested a peddler at the gate. The colonel wishes
to speak to you."</p>

<p>Alfred took the receiver. "They have the peddler
at the gate. They are bringing him over now,
so be kind enough to get here at once," was the
message.</p>

<p>Alfred hurried to the commandant's office, and
met Ralph at the door.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span></p>

<p>"Too bad; they have gotten the wrong peddler.
He is in that room. Look in through the door and
see what you think," said Ralph.</p>

<p>Alfred waited and finally obtained a glimpse.
"No, it doesn't look like the man we spotted.
What was this fellow selling?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"There's his pack," said the orderly.</p>

<p>"That looks just like the pack that our peddler
had. Same kind of things, too; same strap,&mdash;and
that flap; well,&mdash;I'll bet he belongs to the other
fellow, or knows something about him," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"What is that?" said the colonel, as he entered
and heard the last remark.</p>

<p>"I just said that this pack is just the same, the
flap and the belt are exactly like the one the peddler
had that we are after, and although that
doesn't look like the man, I wouldn't be surprised
if he belonged to the same gang," answered Alfred.</p>

<p>"I have a way that will tell the story," said
Ralph. "Where are the things that were taken
from him?" he asked.</p>

<p>"In my office," said the colonel; "come in and
look them over."</p>

<p>They made a careful examination of the peddler's
pockets, and Ralph shook his head doubtfully.</p>

<p>"Where is his money?" said Alfred.</p>

<p>"That's it!" almost shouted Ralph.</p>

<p>The arresting officer was directed to bring in
the money, and the moment it was deposited on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
table both boys stared at the paper wrapped
around it.</p>

<p>"I think we know some of the figures on that
paper," said Ralph.</p>

<p>The colonel looked at the boys incredulously.
"If you do," he said, "I should call it some pretty
fine detective work."</p>

<p>"There are figures here," said the officer, unwrapping
the paper.</p>

<p>"Do you see 42 there?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the officer.</p>

<p>"Now, right next to it or very near, is there a
figure 8, and then 3?"</p>

<p>The officer looked at Ralph in amazement.
"That is just what I note here, and in the order
you have given," he said.</p>

<p>"Now look for the following numbers, which
ought to be up somewhere above those you have
just mentioned: 10, 8 and 6. Do you find them
there?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Yes," replied the officer. "But there is another
amount here, 14."</p>

<p>"That represents the fourteen unpacked aeroplanes,"
said Alfred.</p>

<p>"What do you know about them?" asked the
colonel.</p>

<p>"Joe told me there were that many in the
cases," answered Alfred.</p>

<p>"Well, I wonder where that fellow has hidden
himself?" said Ralph.</p>

<p>"How did you know about the numbers on that
paper?" asked the colonel.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span></p>

<p>"We saw him put them down; and that is what
created the suspicion in our minds," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"One thing more," said Ralph. "May I examine
the paper?"</p>

<p>He scanned it from top to bottom, then turned to
the colonel. "How many men," he asked, "were in
the regiment that came in about an hour ago?"</p>

<p>The colonel turned to the orderly. The latter
replied: "890, according to the rolls, if you mean
the 23d Essex."</p>

<p>"There it is," said Ralph, pointing to the figures.</p>

<p>The colonel stooped over. "Where is 890?
What you are pointing to is 8.90, and it may have
reference to the sales he made to the members of
the regiment," he observed.</p>

<p>"But he didn't make any sales to any of the
fellows there," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Are you sure of that?" asked the colonel.</p>

<p>"We are both sure of that," replied Ralph,
"and what is still more, here is 23 right above it
with an X following. Doesn't that mean the 23d
Essex regiment?"</p>

<p>"Well, I consider that a pretty piece of reasoning
from observation," said the colonel.</p>

<p>The boys turned to the colonel and fairly stared
at him.</p>

<p>"I hope I have not offended you."</p>

<p>"No; we didn't feel that way about your remark,
but it reminded me of the lesson that the
captain of the artillery company gave us one night
on the value of observation," said Alfred.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span></p>

<p>"Bring in the man; I think we have a clear
case," ordered the colonel.</p>

<p>He was ushered in and the colonel addressed
him. "When did you come into the grounds?"</p>

<p>"About an hour ago," was the reply.</p>

<p>"Were you on the grounds when the Essex regiment
arrived?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"This paper which was wrapped around your
money contains an account of the sales you made
at various times; is that so?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What was the sum total of the sales you made
to the regiment?"</p>

<p>He leaned forward and glanced over the paper,
as he responded:</p>

<p>"Eight francs and nine centimes."</p>

<p>"What did you sell that brought 23 centimes?"
asked the colonel with a scrutinizing gaze.</p>

<p>"Are you sure that 23 meant centimes?"</p>

<p>The man's face paled, and for the first time he
hesitated to reply promptly. The colonel gave him
no time to collect his thoughts.</p>

<p>"What does the X stand for following 23?"</p>

<p>"Ten."</p>

<p>"Ten what?"</p>

<p>"The profit I made."</p>

<p>"On what? On the 8.90?"</p>

<p>"Yes," was the relieved reply.</p>

<p>"Put him under guard," ordered the colonel.</p>

<p>As the man was led away, Ralph said: "While
he is dressed differently, and appears to look<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
somewhat unlike the peddler we spotted, I think it
is the same man," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"That pack might show something. Do you object
if we take out all the things?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Of course not; that fellow is guilty; I am sure
of that," said the colonel.</p>

</div>


<p>The goods were unpacked. In the bottom,
neatly folded, was the identical suit that the peddler
wore when the boys first noticed him.</p>

<p>"He simply shifted suits somewhere in the
grounds, and altered his personal appearance. I
regard that as very clever, on your part, boys, and
the service shall be rewarded," said the colonel.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
"Now, tell me about your adventures since you
left Dunkirk."</p>

<p>For an hour the boys were busy telling the colonel
about their experiences, their work in the
aerial corps, and in the artillery, to all of which
he listened with the most intense interest. At the
close of the interview the colonel said:</p>

<p>"Where are you now staying?"</p>

<p>"Anywhere, and nowhere," said Ralph, with a
laugh.</p>

<p>"Well, you are entitled to a comfortable place,
and you shall have it right here. The orderly will
see that you are well taken care of; here, Cameron,
put up the boys and see that they get anything
they want."</p>

<p>"Thank you," replied both. As they were passing
out the door, an officer was about to enter.</p>

<p>"One moment, boys; this is Captain Rose, in
charge of the Secret Service. We have had an
interesting experience since you left this morning,
Captain. Go over to the quarter with the boys and
they will tell you about it, for I shall depend on
your co-operation to convict the fellow."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER IX<br />
<span class="small">THE LAWS AGAINST SPIES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>"Did you notice the colonel said that we could
have anything we wanted?" said Ralph, after they
were once installed in their room in a wing of
the building where the officers were sheltered.</p>

<p>"I hope he won't forget it," said Alfred. "Tell
him we want to be assigned to the artillery
branch."</p>

<p>"Perhaps we ought to wait until we get through
with the peddler, as Captain Rose said the case
would come up in the morning," replied Ralph.</p>

<p>"Too bad we haven't told Joe. I wonder where
he puts up? Maybe the captain knows," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"We might look him up," replied Ralph, and
they were quickly out of the room and prancing
across the parade ground toward the commandant's
quarters, where the main offices were located.
As it was past nine at night they had
some difficulty in locating Joe, but he was eventually
found, and at eleven o'clock they left the
quarters in the rear of the hangars, and marched
across the ground in the direction of their building.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span></p>

<p>Turning the corner they were confronted by an
individual who caused the boys to gasp. It was
the peddler,&mdash;the identical individual they had
followed during the day. He glanced at the boys,
then turned and hurried away.</p>

<p>"We mustn't let him get away this time," said
Ralph.</p>

<p>The man evidently heard Ralph's voice, for he
hurried his steps.</p>

<p>"Halt!" cried Alfred.</p>

<p>The man paid no attention to the command.</p>

<p>"Halt or we'll shoot!" shouted Ralph.</p>

<p>The man hesitated, then stopped and turned
around.</p>

<p>"Face the other way," shouted Ralph.</p>

<p>The man obeyed. Neither of the boys were
armed. It was an awkward position.</p>

<p>"Run for the captain," said Ralph in a whisper.</p>

<p>Alfred quietly walked around the corner and
fairly flew across the ground.</p>

<p>"We've got him; come on quickly," said Alfred
in excitement, as he burst into the captain's
room without waiting for an invitation. The captain
was about to retire, and jumped up with a
roar of laughter as he recognized Alfred.</p>

<p>"Who is it? What is up?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"The peddler!" replied Alfred.</p>

<p>"I'll be there as soon as I can get something
on," said the captain.</p>

<p>"Then I'll borrow this," said Alfred, seizing
the heavy army revolver, "if I may."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span></p>

<p>He rushed out of the door without waiting to
get the desired permission, and reached the corner
of the building just as Ralph was shouting:
"Halt, I say!"</p>

<p>Evidently the man began to doubt the authority
or the sincerity of his would-be captor, for he
turned just as Alfred emerged from the corner.
One look was sufficient. The peddler bolted for
the shelter of the buildings to the left.</p>

<p>Alfred raised the revolver and fired. The man
stopped.</p>

<p>"Come this way!" ordered Ralph.</p>

<p>The shot at such a time was sufficient warning
for the guards and the officers. They swarmed
from all sides, as the boys advanced toward the
peddler.</p>

<p>One of the first to arrive was the captain, half-dressed.
He was the only one who understood the
meaning of the shot. Alfred handed him the
weapon, and in another moment the peddler was
in the hands of the captain and on the way to the
lock-up.</p>

<p>As they marched across the ground the colonel
ran up.</p>

<p>"What's this!" he asked the boys, as they were
following the captain and the prisoner.</p>

<p>"We have him this time," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Who?" asked the colonel.</p>

<p>"The real peddler," said Alfred.</p>

<p>The aroused camp soon learned of the work of
the boys. It is marvelous how soon things of this
character drift from mouth to mouth. Earlier in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
the day the camp knew of the capture of a spy;
that seemed to be common knowledge. The incident
which had just taken place seemed to be
a fitting complement to the happening of the day,
and in both instances the boys had a prominent
part.</p>

<p>Naturally, the boys had to go to headquarters
and relate the circumstances surrounding their
latest exploit, so that it was late in the morning
before they were able to get to their room and
retire.</p>

<p>"I feel a sort of sympathy for those fellows,"
said Alfred, while dressing the next morning.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't," replied Ralph. "They are
mean sneakers; they daren't do anything openly.
They ought to be shot if they are really spies."</p>

<p>"There's one thing about this business I can't
understand," said Alfred. "I don't think spying
is any worse than other things that are done in
war. It isn't worse than killing, is it?"</p>

<p>"No; but don't you remember Lieutenant
Guyon saying that it was not the doing of a thing,
but the <i>way</i> it was done that was wrong," said
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Well, I can't see how that helps things in the
least. Here comes the captain; he just passed the
window. Come in!" said Alfred. "We've been
discussing what is right and what is wrong in war.
I said that it didn't seem to me to be any worse
to spy than to do anything else."</p>

<p>"There is nothing wrong in spying,&mdash;that is,
trying to find out what your enemy is doing; that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
isn't it. If a man does it openly, and not in disguise,
he is protected. It is only when fellows
take the guise of a peddler, we will say, that the
rules of war decide he is entitled to no consideration
and cannot be protected," answered the
captain.</p>

<p>"I must say, now that I think of it, that there
must be something wrong about the laws that
are made to use such an excuse to execute a man.
I read in the papers a few weeks ago that one of
the war vessels exhibited a neutral flag until the
unsuspecting ship got near enough so it could
attack. Now, if it was wrong for an individual
to deceive, or sail under false colors, why wasn't it
wrong for a ship to do that very thing?" remarked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"You are right about that, undoubtedly," said
the captain, "but, of course, we must be guided
by what law is, and not by what we think or know
it ought to be. If the peddlers are guilty they
must suffer," answered the captain.</p>

<p>"I agree with you," said Alfred. "Of course,
those men knew the risks they were taking, and
they did it with their eyes open. That reconciles
me."</p>

<p>"Yes; and the very thing those fellows tried
to do would mean, if they succeeded, death to
many of our soldiers, and it is better for two to
die than to have hundreds suffer," remarked
Ralph.</p>

<p>The evidence brought forth at the trial that day
was conclusive. The men refused to make any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
statements concerning their co-operation in the
work of espionage, but when the second peddler's
pack was eventually discovered, it was learned
that each carried a suit, the counterpart of the
other.</p>

<p>It was obvious that the arrest of one would enable
him to prove an alibi, just as he was prepared
to do when the first one was apprehended by the
boys, and he would have been successful, too, were
it not for the fact that the boys observed the man
in the act of taking notes, or jotting down items
so systematically, and on several occasions items
were put down where no sales were effected.</p>

<p>No time was lost in carrying out the orders of
the court and the spies were executed without delay.</p>

<p>The boys remained in the camp for two weeks,
and it was getting to be irksome. There seemed
to be no occasion for hurry. Soldiers were arriving
from England in every branch of the service,
and the camp was enlarged by taking in a
vast plain directly to the west and adjoining the
main camp.</p>

<p>"I wonder if the colonel will forget what he
said about giving us whatever we want," said
Ralph, one morning.</p>

<p>"We might as well find out," replied Alfred.</p>

<p>Once in the colonel's presence they were quick
to bring up the subject.</p>

<p>"You may remember," said Ralph, "that you
once told us that we could have anything we
wanted."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<p>"I remember it well," he said. "Now, what is
it?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Why, we want to join an artillery company,"
said Alfred.</p>

<p>"And is that all?" he inquired with an amused
air.</p>

<p>"Yes; we thought you might help us out; of
course, we know we are minors, and Americans,
and all that, but we can help out, just the same,"
said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes; that is, indeed, commendable. Your
cases are so different from the ordinary ones that
it may make the job of getting you in much easier;
at any rate, I hope so," he remarked.</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Now, mind you, I may not be able to succeed,
for the War Department is very particular, and
we are working under a pretty rigid set of rules,
but you have been in the service and are entitled
to consideration; and, by the way, won't you tell
me how you succeeded in getting in heretofore.
Did you have any influence to push you along?"
asked the colonel.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes; we had considerable influence," said
Alfred with a smile.</p>

<p>"Yes, that's what I wanted to find out," replied
the colonel. "How did you work it?"</p>

<p>"Well," replied Ralph, "we simply walked in
and went to work; that's the influence we had; they
couldn't help but take us."</p>

<p>The colonel leaned back in his chair and roared
with laughter, in which the boys joined.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span></p>

<p>"Maybe it wasn't just as bad as that," rejoined
Alfred, after the laughter subsided, "but down at
Bar-le-Duc the chances of getting in with the
flyers were pretty slim, so we just went into the
hangars and asked them what there was to do, and
we didn't wait for them to tell us, we simply went
to work."</p>

<p>"That's a sample of the way we worked also
to get into the transportation service,&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"So you've been in that, too? Tell me about
it," said the colonel.</p>

<p>"Down at Amiens we saw them loading up a
military truck, and they looked as though they
were rather short of help, so we pitched in and
helped fill up the van. It happened we were on
the van when it started for the front, and that's
where we had a lively experience in taking the
vans through Devil's Cut," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Devil's Cut! I've heard about that! But I
imagine there isn't any more trouble in that place
now," observed the colonel.</p>

<p>"No, indeed! The big drive spoiled Devil's
Cut," said Alfred, "and we helped the artillery
to do it, and that's why we want another chance in
the same direction."</p>

<p>If there is anything more disagreeable than another,
it is waiting. Waiting for something, good
or bad, is equally discouraging. In their wanderings
they had become acquainted with a quaint
corporal, formerly of the British navy, and at that
time a trainer for the various gun squads at the
camp. Daily guns were prepared and hurried to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
the front, and Walker, the corporal, was always
on hand and frequently accompanied the guns as
they were sent forward.</p>

<p>"Would you like to have a little outing?" he
remarked one morning, as the boys appeared at
his tent.</p>

<p>"Yes; anything, to get a change, this is too trying,"
said Ralph.</p>


<div class="figcenter">

  <div class="caption">
    <span class="small"><i>Pontooning Heavy Guns Across a Stream</i></span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>"Well, we are going to send half a dozen heavy
guns out the Bapaume road this morning, so
along," he remarked.</p>

<p>Six horses were hitched to each piece, and were
pulling out, as Walker spoke.</p>

<p>"Jump on this ammunition van," shouted
Walker, as he ran forward and seized the stanchions
at the side.</p>

<p>The boys needed no second invitation, for they
would, at least, have an opportunity to go over a
great deal of the ground formerly occupied by the
Germans, before the British commenced the
Somme drive.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span></p>

<p>"Why don't you use lorries for these guns?"
asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"There is one very good reason," replied
Walker. "The bridges are down, and we haven't
had time to repair them, and the pontoons are too
light for the heavy pieces we are taking across, so
we have to adopt an entirely new method," he
said, shrugging his shoulders and making a grimace,
which, at first, seemed very comical to the
boys.</p>

<p>"Then how do you get them across? Is the
river very deep?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"About ten feet deep, I should say; of course,
we can't run them across on their own wheels, but
we pontoon them over," he said.</p>

<p>The subject was dropped for the moment, as
one of the officers came in at that moment to consult
with Walker. The boys seemed to be puzzled
at his remarks, and when he returned he said:</p>

<p>"When we reach the end of this road, beyond,
we turn to the right, at a point only a few hundred
feet from the river. Well, just notice the heavy
barrels at the landing."</p>

<p>As the corner was turned they quickly observed
the barrels, and men busily engaged with ropes
and heavy poles. A gun was run on its wheels
close to the river's edge, and five of the barrels
were secured to two poles, and lashed forward of
the wheels, the poles running transversely. A like
number of guns were then secured behind the
wheels, also held by cross poles.</p>

<p>All of the barrels were hung higher than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
tread of the wheels, so that after the equipment,
as thus explained, was fully attached, the horses
were driven into the river and hitched to the floating
gun, while others mounted the float thus constructed,
and, with poles, assisted in floating the
piece across.</p>

<p>There was not a single mishap, and the six guns
were taken over in a brief space of time. The ammunition
wagons were taken across by way of
the pontoon bridge, crowded as it was, and the
entire outfit assembled on the other side within
an hour of the time the stream was reached.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER X<br />
<span class="small">A DIFFICULT TRIP TO THE MAIN TRENCHES</span></h2>
</div>

<p>The great camp at which the boys were located
was south of Albert, a town of about 7,000 inhabitants,
at the opening of the war. It was less than
ten miles west of the first line trenches at that
time. About fifteen miles northeast was Bapaume,
and southeast of Albert, the same direction, was
Peronne, towns of 3,000 and 5,000 respectively,
both within the German lines, and important distributing
centers for the armies in that region.</p>

<p>"I do not know how true it is, but the information
I have is that the immense preparation going
on here, and farther to the north, means a drive
on Bapaume and Peronne. If such is the case we
may expect lively times during the next three
months," said the lieutenant, as they were conversing
about the probabilities of taking part.</p>

<p>"What branch of the service were you in?"
asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"The artillery; that is the most important by
all means, especially in this war," was the answer.</p>

<p>"How is it that you are not attached?" asked
Alfred.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<p>"Immediately after the Boer war I resigned,
went to America, and engaged in business there.
As soon as I could do so I disposed of my interests
and came back two months ago. I was sent to this
point two weeks ago, where, undoubtedly, I will
be called upon to take a part," was the lieutenant's
reply.</p>

<p>That evening in their rooms, Ralph remarked:
"I think we ought to stick pretty close to the lieutenant;
there might be a chance for us there."</p>

<p>"But suppose the colonel fixes it for us?" said
Alfred.</p>

<p>"Then we'll go," answered Ralph.</p>

<p>"While we are waiting, suppose we make a trip
to the trenches," suggested Ralph.</p>

<p>"When? Tomorrow?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Why not?" replied Ralph.</p>

<p>"Suppose we start early in the morning, as soon
as we have breakfast," suggested Alfred.</p>

<p>As they walked across the ground, preparatory
to the start, in the morning they were accosted by
the captain. "Which way?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Going to take a look at the boys in
the trenches," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"I can give you a lift," replied the captain.
"Go over to the station and ask for Lieutenant
Moore; tell him who you are and that I requested
him to give you a place on the goods train.</p>

<p>"That was a happy thought," said Alfred, after
they had thanked the captain. "It's good to have
friends," he added.</p>

<p>At the station they were disappointed to learn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
that the lieutenant was at the other end of the
line. "Where is his assistant?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"That's the man over there," said their informant,
pointing to a nervous officer on the platform.</p>

<p>"Sorry I can't accommodate you in the absence
of the lieutenant," was his discouraging reply to
their inquiries.</p>

<p>"Well, shall we walk it?" said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Not as long as the railroad is here; I have gotten
out of the idea of walking since the captain
made the suggestion," said Alfred, as he looked
about.</p>

<p>"That looks as though it might go the right
way," said Ralph, as he pointed to a long train
and noticed a squad of men closing the doors.
While walking across they saw an engine backed
up and coupled on the coaches.</p>

<p>"This is our chance," said Ralph.</p>

<p>The conductor gave the signal and slowly the
train began to move. Ralph sprang up on the running
board, and, calling to Alfred, said: "Just in
time!"</p>

<p>"Ay, there! where's your permit?" shouted a
voice.</p>

<p>"Permit?" said Ralph. "Permit to get to the
front? Well, that's news to me. Did you ever
hear anything like that?" he continued.</p>

<p>The latter laughed at the audacity of the remark,
but the conductor assumed that it was a
species of assurance on the part of the boys, and
it caused him to hesitate.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span></p>

<p>The boys, meanwhile, boldly crept up the ladder
and landed on top, where they quietly sat down,
with their legs dangling over the side. After the
train had gone a mile or so the conductor mounted
the last coach and walked forward.</p>

<p>"Hi 'ave me orders to allow no one without a
permit," he said.</p>

<p>"Well, you ask Lieutenant Moore whether we
can ride or not," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Hey, but it must be in writing," he answered.</p>

<p>"Yes; we know that; we will get the written permit
as soon as we get to the other end of the line
where the lieutenant is," said Ralph, with an assuring
nod.</p>

<p>"Blime me if this isn't irregular," he said.</p>

<p>"Yes, it may be," answered Alfred. "It isn't
exactly regular to ride on top, but we haven't been
invited to have a seat in the caboose," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Caboose! caboose! did you say? Hi never
heard of it," replied the conductor.</p>

<p>"Never heard of a caboose?" said Alfred.
"That's queer; I thought all railroad men knew
what that meant."</p>

<p>"Why, he's never been in America. They don't
have cabooses in England. You ought to know
that," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Oh, yes, Mr. Conductor, over in the United
States all our freight trains have cabooses on the
rear end for the use of the train hands," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Freight trains! My word, you confuse me.
And what do you mean by train hands?" he asked.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, this is a freight train, and your men are
train hands," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Ah! you mean <i>goods</i> train and train <i>crews</i>,"
said the man.</p>

<p>The boys laughed heartily, as this was really the
first opportunity they had for a lark since they
reached France.</p>

<p>The laughter seemed to infect the conductor.
Two of the train crew came forward, and finally
joined in the conversation, and the matter of the
permit was entirely forgotten. The conductor
turned out to be really human after all. What interested
him was the information that the boys
were Americans, and when Ralph told them that
they were aviators and had been in a fight above
the clouds, they fairly owned the train, and everybody
in it.</p>

<p>In due time they reached what is known as Siding
8, one of the regular stations on the way. It
was a military road, passage on the trains being
permitted only by means of written orders. The
boys knew this, of course, but they had had months
of experience in traveling over roads of this character,
and knew the value of bluff and of assuming
situations which would be hard to controvert.
At any rate they were now sure of reaching the
end of the journey without molestation.</p>

<p>They felt sure of this until the train stopped at
Siding 8. A pompous individual approached the
group.</p>

<p>"That is the inspector," said one of the men in
an aside to Ralph.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

<p>"I am afraid it's all up with us," said Alfred.</p>

<p>As he neared the group the boys both gave the
regulation salute, which was recognized by the officer.</p>

<p>"Where are you bound for?" he asked.</p>

<p>"To the front," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"What front? Where?" he persisted.</p>

<p>"Anywhere; so we get there," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Where are your permits?" he asked.</p>

<p>"We haven't any," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Then how did you get here on this train?" he
asked sternly, glancing at the conductor, who was
now squirming.</p>

<p>"We rode on top most of the way," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Who gave you permission to do so?" he fired
at them.</p>

<p>"No one; we didn't need any permission; we
simply got on and here we are," said Alfred.</p>

<p>There was a faint snicker in their rear. The
officer colored up. "I will make a report of this,"
said the officer, glancing at the conductor, and
drawing out a book he proceeded to write down
the name of the conductor and the number of the
train.</p>

<p>"What are your names?" he asked, turning to
the boys.</p>

<p>"Now, see here, Lieutenant, you are doing your
duty; we know that," said Ralph. "We're just
plain American boys with a little deviltry in us
sometimes, and the conductor isn't to blame. We
have just come out of the hospital after a pretty
hot time in the artillery service, and Captain Rose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
at the camp told us to tell Lieutenant Moore that
we wanted transportation. At the station we
found he was at this end of the line, so we took this
means to get the permit from him."</p>

<p>"In the service, eh? Where?" he snapped.</p>

<p>"At Verdun and at St. Quentin," answered Alfred.</p>

<p>The answer seemed to soften him. "I am
sorry," he continued in a different tone, "but I
cannot allow you to go on without a permit." The
boys stepped off the car.</p>

<p>"I would suggest a good way out of the
trouble," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Very well!" he answered.</p>

<p>"Suppose you issue us a permit; that will get
us there without further trouble," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"I have no authority to issue permits," he replied.</p>

<p>"Well, then," said Alfred, "suppose you did
have the authority to issue them would you give
us permission to go on in that case?"</p>

<p>"Most assuredly," was the reply.</p>

<p>The second section of the train was approaching
and the Inspector hurried back. The signal
was given and the train commenced to move.</p>

<p>"Jump in!" said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Just what I was going to do," replied Alfred.
"He didn't fill up his blank to make the report.
You are all right," continued Alfred, addressing
the conductor.</p>

<p>The latter smiled at the neat manner in which
the boys had handled the situation, and the train<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
crew had a good laugh at the expense of the inspector.</p>

<p>Siding 8 was just two miles from the trenches,&mdash;that
is, from the active zone. All along this section
were ditches, like vast drains, which were
once occupied by the Germans. Cannon were constantly
booming, but so common had such noises
become that they ceased to attract the notice of the
boys. Soon the great lines of tents and temporary
barracks were visible. The most intense activity
prevailed in every quarter.</p>

<p>The boys left the train as soon as it reached its
destination, having in their minds one thing only
and that was to get to the front trenches, and, if
possible, get in touch with the batteries. They
were aware that it was a difficult matter to obtain
permission for either of those purposes, but they
relied more on the conditions under which they
might find themselves, to obtain their ends.</p>

<p>Leading from the station was a road which entered
a village. One of the trenches not then occupied,
but which had been made by the Germans,
extended alongside this road directly through the
little hamlet. Several stores were in operation,
and at one of them were noticed a half dozen
civilians, all discussing means to get a glimpse of
the operations near the front.</p>

<p>"It is no use," said one of them. "They will
not grant any permits to go nearer, and I understand
that the reason is they are preparing to
cut their way through to Bapaume."</p>

<p>"That fellow's an American, I'll bet on that."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span></p>

<p>"Talks like it, anyway," responded Alfred.</p>

<p>"We may have a chance to help in another artillery
battle, if what he says is so," observed
Ralph. "Hello! what's this?" continued Ralph,
as a black and white terrier approached, wagging
its tail. Ralph patted it and looked around expecting
to find its owner.</p>

<p>"Come on," said Alfred. "We aren't getting
anywhere at this rate. We might go through the
village and inquire."</p>

<p>The terrier followed, every moment or two friskily
coming up close and looking up at them wistfully.
They discouraged him by paying no attention
to his show of friendliness.</p>

<p>"It looks as though he had adopted us," said
Alfred. "Come here, Frisky; do we suit you?"</p>

<p>"I feel mighty hungry; there's a stall. We
might get a bite, and we'll get some information at
the same time," said Ralph.</p>

<p>They entered the apology called a restaurant,
and ordered coffee with rolls and butter. Cold
meat was the only other thing available.</p>

<p>"Let's have some of that," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Where are the nearest front line trenches?"
asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"About a mile to the east," said the waiter.
"You'll have trouble getting there, since the new
orders went into effect."</p>

<p>"What new orders?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"To permit no passes," he replied.</p>

<p>"I don't think we need any passes," said Ralph
in an undertone.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span></p>

<p>"Do you belong to the army?" asked the
waiter.</p>

<p>"No; but we expect to," answered Ralph.</p>

<p>The meal finished they were about to go, but
Frisky danced about them.</p>

<p>"Poor fellow! we forgot him," said Alfred, giving
the dog some scraps, which he speedily devoured.
That meal sealed a bond of friendship, on
the part of the dog, at least, and as they marched
out the road to the east Frisky followed, dancing
about them continually, and exhibiting his pleasure,
dog-fashion, in his newly found friends.</p>

<p>"Is that a guard line ahead?" observed Ralph,
as they approached a shed-like structure, and saw
a group of soldiers with guns standing near.</p>

<p>"I suppose it is," replied Alfred. "Here is
where we make a halt, I suppose."</p>

<p>Alfred was right. No one dared cross the line
which extended north and south of the structure.
It was the dead line, and there was no hope for
them, so as there was no use to argue the matter
they sadly turned back, retraced their steps
through the village and without any prearrangement
turned to the right.</p>

<p>"We might see something from that hill," said
Ralph.</p>

<p>"That is just what was in my mind," remarked
Alfred.</p>

<p>The narrow road was observed winding around
the hill and going up diagonally. Half way to
the hill, and at a point where there was a perceptible
ascent, Frisky ran forward, barking furiously.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
He stopped at the remains of a ragged
fence, beyond which was soon observed the ruins
of a low building.</p>

<p>"I suppose that is one of the cottages destroyed
by the fighting," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Frisky is acting queerly," remarked Alfred.
"Let us go over." The animal would run around
the ruin, then come back, look up at them, and
actually seem to want to talk.</p>

<p>"I suppose that is an invitation to follow him,"
said Ralph.</p>

<p>As the boys passed over the fence Frisky
showed his pleasure by emitting a series of short,
sharp barks, which he kept up continually, running
around as though in the greatest excitement.</p>

<p>"I wonder what he does that for?" said Alfred.
"Come here, Frisky, poor fellow!" said
Ralph, as he stooped and fondled the little fellow.
Frisky nestled up close and gave a peculiar whine.</p>

<p>"I believe that was his home," said Alfred,
"and this is his way of telling it. I would like
to know what became of the people who lived
here."</p>

<p>"Come on, Frisky; we'll take care of you," said
Ralph, with a hug.</p>

<p>As they passed out of the enclosure Frisky followed,
apparently cured of his singular actions.
Half way up the hill they met a tottering old man,
carrying a bundle of faggots.</p>

<p>"Do you know anything about the people who
lived in that ruined cottage?" said Ralph.</p>

<p>The old man shook his head.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span></p>

<p>"He doesn't understand English," said Alfred,
who put the question in French.</p>

<p>He looked at the dog and replied: "The cottage
was struck by the first shell that the Germans
fired from yonder hill when they came through
here on their way to Paris. The house was torn
to pieces and all were killed."</p>

<p>Ralph pointed to the dog. The old man nodded.
"He goes up there every day; they can't keep him
away. The soldiers have stolen him many times,
but he always comes back."</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other in silence.
"Come here, Frisky!" finally said Alfred, as he
held out his hand. He leaped toward the boys,
and put up his paws on each of them in turn, while
the old man turned sadly away and shambled down
the hill.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span class="small">DISCOVERING A GERMAN RANGE FINDER</span></h2>
</div>

<p>It seemed as though every one they met knew
Frisky, for some of them whistled to him, and a
few tried to entice him to follow, but on the journey
to the west of the hill he followed the boys'
footsteps, and seemed to recognize no one but
them.</p>

<p>"That must be a battery up there," almost
shouted Ralph, as he gazed ahead, and pointed to
a ridge newly made, apparently, of fresh earth.</p>

<p>"It certainly looks like it," answered Alfred,
with enthusiasm, as he bounded forward eagerly
to reach the top.</p>

<p>Evidences of the effect of shells now became
more pronounced, although holes in the earth and
the fallen debris had been noticed everywhere,
even before they had reached the hillside.</p>

<p>"It must be a battery of big guns up there,"
remarked Ralph, as they sat down for a few moments
of rest.</p>

<p>"Yes, that last shot sounded bigger than a 75,"
answered Alfred.</p>

<p>"I wonder what Frisky is doing over there?"
said Ralph, glancing across a small ravine to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
left, where the animal was engaged in briskly pawing
the earth.</p>

<p>"I suppose he has treed something; suppose we
investigate," replied Alfred.</p>

<p>They quickly found their way through the
tangled brush and broken stone down the little
hollow and up again to the mound-like structure
where Frisky was engaged.</p>

<p>"What have you found?" asked Ralph, as they
neared the scene.</p>

<p>Frisky answered with a quick yelp, and kept
on digging. Evidently there was something in the
burrow before him.</p>

<p>"What kind of animals do they have here in
France?" said Ralph. "I don't think I ever saw
even a field mouse since we came here."</p>

<p>"No wonder; we've never been anywhere except
in spots like this, and it is certain animals
wouldn't last long in such places," replied Alfred.</p>

<p>"We might help Frisky out a little," said Ralph,
as he grasped a stick, and began to rake out the
earth.</p>

<p>While they were at work Alfred was lying with
his back against a low mound. He happened to
turn around and noticed that the upper part of
the elevation was smooth, and contained certain
marks and inscriptions.</p>

<p>"What's this?" shouted Alfred, as he arose and
gazed down on it.</p>

<p>Ralph, somewhat startled, sprang out of the
hollow and drew himself up.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">118</a></span></p>

<p>"What have you got?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Here is a mark of some kind; now what can it
be?" said Alfred, pointing down to the stone.</p>

<p>"That is singular," remarked Ralph. "A cross,
a circle, two arrows, and a set of figures. I suppose
it means something, and is there for some
purpose."</p>


<div class="figcenter">

  </div>
</div>


<p>"It may be a surveyor's post; no, that's not the
name of it either. What was it the professor
called the marking place where they measure
from?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"I don't know what you mean," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Why, when they locate a station, or a particular
spot and then sight from that place to the next;&mdash;what
is it called?&mdash;oh, I know; it's a <i>bench</i>,"
said Alfred.</p>

<p>"So it is; I had forgotten the name," answered
Ralph.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span></p>

<p>Frisky kept on digging, and had worked his way
in until he was almost hidden.</p>

<p>"I am afraid you will have to stop," said Alfred,
but Frisky didn't cease his efforts. "Come
on, we might as well reach the top," continued Alfred,
walking away.</p>

<p>Ralph gave another glance at the inscription,
and turned to follow. As he gazed across the brow
of the hill he stopped.</p>

<p>"Alfred," he said, "this arrow points straight
to that hill in the southwest; do you see that figure
there? I wonder if there is anything in that?"
said Ralph.</p>

<p>"I wish I had a straight stick, and then we could
tell exactly," remarked Alfred, as he looked
around for something to verify the assertion.</p>

<p>"Use a string," said Ralph. "Here is one;
wait, and let me stand right over the stone. Now,
I'm going to stretch it and hold it parallel with
the arrow below. When I give the word sight
along the string and see whether or not it crosses
the hill in the distance."</p>

<p>"All right," answered Alfred. "Lower the
right hand a little; it over-shoots the hill too
much; are you ready?"</p>

<p>"Yes; how is it?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Oh, it points down to the hollow left of the
hill," said Alfred, "so I suppose the mark must
be intended for something else."</p>

<p>"Come on, Frisky; enough of that," shouted
Alfred. "Up the hill," and he marched off whistling.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span></p>

<p>After Ralph started Frisky jumped out of the
hole, gave a few discouraging barks, and leaped
after the boys.</p>

<p>Within fifteen minutes the motor camp was
reached; then great cave-like holes were noticed,
stored with huge shells, and numerous smaller
caves, in which were men lying about.</p>

<p>"There the guns are," said Alfred. "Well,
they have them nicely hidden, and I don't see how
the flyers would ever pick them out the way they
are arranged."</p>

<p>A guard blocked the way, and a corporal approached.
"Your business," he said.</p>

<p>"We are from the 14th French Artillery; just
came out of the hospital a few weeks ago," said
Ralph.</p>

<p>"Have you authority to pass the lines?" asked
the corporal.</p>

<p>"No; we just came over from the field base today;
didn't think it was necessary," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"I will report," said the orderly, as he turned
on his heels and marched alongside the hill to one
of the dug-outs.</p>

<p>An officer approached; the boys saluted.</p>

<p>"From the 14th, I understand," he said. "Any
credentials?" he quickly remarked.</p>

<p>The boys looked at each other, for they were
now conscious of the fact that they did not have
the first evidence to sustain the contention that
they were members of the 14th.</p>

<p>Ralph shook his head. Alfred reached into his
pocket and drew out the certificate of the physician,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
which detailed the wounding, the detention
at the hospital, and the discharge.</p>

<p>The officer examined the paper with some interest.</p>

<p>"We were never regularly enlisted in the artillery,
but we helped them out when they had the big
drive there a month ago," said Ralph. "It was
there we were wounded."</p>

<p>"Here is something that may be just as good,"
said Alfred. "We did belong to the Aviation
corps, and got wounded while serving there, too,
and here is our discharge, and the other certificate
from the hospital."</p>

<p>"That looks pretty straight," said the officer.
"Come in and you may look around for a half
hour. At that time the firing will proceed, and
no one is permitted closer than the motor house."</p>

<p>"Those guns are the same size as the ones
mounted on the dunes at Dunkirk," said Ralph,
after a silence, as he glanced under the cover of
the first one.</p>

<p>"What do you know about the Dunkirk guns?"</p>

<p>"We were there nearly a week before we went
to Paris," said Alfred. "We had an opportunity
to examine them while they were hauling them out
of the boats and setting them up," replied Alfred.</p>

<p>"Why, that was at the beginning of the war,"
remarked the officer.</p>

<p>"Yes; it was just after they drove us across
northern Belgium," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Where were you driven from?" asked the officer,
in a surprised voice.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span></p>

<p>"From Antwerp," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"So you boys took a hand from the first?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes, from the very first day, and, I guess, from
the first hour," said Ralph, with a smile.</p>

<p>"When was that?" asked another officer, who
had overheard the remark.</p>

<p>"At five o 'clock, on the 3d day of August, 1914,"
said Alfred in measured tones.</p>

<p>"Right you are," responded the officer.</p>

<p>As they passed the third giant field piece, the
gunners were at setting up exercise,&mdash;that is, going
through their paces initiating a green squad
of recruits in the manoeuvers necessary to load,
aim and fire.</p>

<p>"That looks natural," said Ralph, "and they
do it well, too; but we never had any exercises except
with the 75's."</p>

<p>"Look at that hill over there; they are pointing
straight at it; so it seems to me. Isn't that
the hill we saw from the bench marks below?"
asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"So it is," answered Ralph. Then, turning to
the officer, he continued: "Are you bombarding
that hill?"</p>

<p>"We are not sure where they are located, but
they have a powerful battery somewhere there,
and we have tried for two weeks to find it. You
see we are three and a half miles from that hill,"
said the officer.</p>

<p>"You should aim for that hollow directly north
of the hill," said Alfred.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

<p>Both officers looked at Alfred, who nodded his
head and kept a sober face. Both men began to
laugh. "What makes you think they have their
big battery there?" asked one of them.</p>

<p>"Because we have just been examining the
bench mark which the Germans left on the side
of the hill," replied Ralph.</p>

<p>"What do you mean? Where?" asked the officers
in a breath.</p>

<p>The questions were almost shouted. The excitement
attracted others near by.</p>

<p>"That can't be possible," said one of the officers.</p>

<p>"Do you mean," said another, "that the fellows
over there left a range mark?"</p>

<p>"Well, we don't know about that, exactly, but
in coming up,&mdash;here Frisky,&mdash;our dog treed something
in a hole,&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Treed in a hole,&mdash;ha, ha,&mdash;that's clever!" interrupted
one of the officers. The others laughed
in unison, and the boys joined.</p>

<p>"Well, that's what we call it, at any rate," continued
Alfred. "So we went over to help him
out. Right near the hole was a big flat stone on
top of a mound, and it had the cross marks on it,
some circles, and arrows, and also some marks."</p>

<p>"Where is that?" asked an officer, now thoroughly
sobered.</p>

<p>"But what made you think it had anything to
do with that hill over there?" interrupted another.</p>

<p>"Because the arrow pointed that way, but when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
we made a test we were disappointed, as the arrow
went straight to that hollow place that I referred
to, north of the hill. Now, there may be something
in that; I don't know," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"That is something worth looking into; accompany
us," said the officer.</p>

<p>On the way to the narrow cut which led to the
roadway, the commanding officer of the battery
appeared.</p>

<p>"What is this I hear about finding a range mark
left by the Germans?" he asked.</p>

<p>The matter was explained to him.</p>

<p>"It looks to me like a bench mark," said Alfred,
as they walked down the hill.</p>

<p>"So you have been a surveyor?" said the commander.</p>

<p>"No, sir; never did anything in that line, but
take lessons; what made you think so?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"That happens to be my line, and the term is
one rarely, if ever, used outside of the profession,"
he remarked. "And, by the way, Lieutenant,
did you order the theodolite brought down?"</p>

<p>"I did, sir!" was the response.</p>

<p>The party picked their way along the brush,
Ralph and Alfred in the lead. Back and forth
they stumbled over the hillside, but the longed-for
spot seemed to elude them.</p>

<p>"Now, isn't that singular?" said Ralph. "It
seemed to be on a rather level spot, and there was
a ravine, not a deep one, which we had to cross
to get there. It may be further around the hill,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
for we could see across the country to the east
from the bench."</p>

<p>Back and forth, up and down, and still it could
not be located.</p>

<p>"You are sure it is not far from the road?"
asked one of the officers.</p>

<p>"Why, we were so near we could hear Frisky
pawing and barking,&mdash;where is he now? Hello,
Frisky!" cried out Alfred. "Come, Frisky."</p>

<p>There was a short, quick bark to the right, and
Ralph waved his cap. "He's over there; he's at
the hole now," shouted Ralph, as he disappeared
in a gully.</p>

<p>Ralph was observed climbing the steep incline
at the other side and the party followed.</p>

<p>"Good boy, Frisky!" said Alfred, as he came up
and stooped down to pat the dog.</p>

<p>"That's a remarkable animal; and where did
you get him?" asked the commander.</p>

<p>"He adopted us down in the village this afternoon,"
said Ralph with a chuckle.</p>

<p>The commander threw his head back and fairly
shook with merriment at the remark.</p>

<p>"Ah! that's the devoted dog that used to live at
the stone cottage," said one of the officers. "I
know him now."</p>

<p>"Here's the bench," said Ralph, "and it's
through Frisky we found it."</p>

<p>The officers gathered around the stone and examined
it with intense curiosity. The sketch of
it, which is here appended, shows the marks and
the figures. The face of the stone was about fourteen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
inches across and perfectly flat. On this was
a cross, the limbs of which were a foot long.</p>

<p>The crosses indicated the cardinal points of the
compass; that was evident, as one of them had, at
its extremity, the letter N. Two circles were
scribed, the center being at the crossing point of
the two limbs. One arrow pointed northeast, the
other southeast, one having the figure 7 at the
point, and 47 across the middle of the body, while
the other had 5 at the apex and 52 across the body.</p>

<p>The commander examined the stone intently for
several minutes, occasionally shaking his head.
Evidently something puzzled him.</p>

<p>"I cannot understand the meaning of the circles,
and of the numbers which appear attached to them,
namely, 300, 60 and 200. It is possible they may
be there as a mere blind," he said.</p>

<p>"Captain, isn't it possible that it may be a bench
erected by the French surveyors previous to the
war?" asked an officer.</p>

<p>"It is not at all likely," replied the captain.
"In the first place, the marking is not such as
the French surveyors use; and, in the second place,
the arrows are meant to show a point which would
be of no value to a topographical survey except
for finding certain distant objects."</p>

<p>"Then what do the figures attached to the arrows
mean?" asked an officer.</p>

<p>"The apex figures are kilometers, and those
on the bodies of the arrows represent meters,"
answered the captain.</p>

<p>"Well, the one with the 5 at the end does seem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
to point to the hill we have been shelling for the
past week," said an officer.</p>

<p>"Put up the instrument and get the exact
angle," said the captain.</p>

<p>This was done. The boys' experiments were
confirmed.</p>

<p>"It is just two and a half degrees north of the
peak of the hill," said the officer, looking through
the instrument.</p>

<p>"And it is 5 kilometers, 52 centimeters distant,
and a little over, as the plus mark indicates," said
the captain.</p>

<p>"Now, if that is the distance to the place over
there, we have the exact range also for the other
point, 7 kilometers and 47 centimeters beyond.
The question in my mind is," said the officer, "has
it reference to a battery location?"</p>

<p>"Have you figured out the distance of 5.52 kilometers
in miles?" asked the captain.</p>

<p>"Yes; it is a trifle over three and a half miles,
or to be exact, 18,488 feet," said the officer.</p>

<p>"You see that corresponds within a hundred
feet or so of the triangulated measurement we
made of the hill," said the captain.</p>

<p>"One thing is sure, however, that if their big
battery is on that hill, or near it, they have some
way of protecting it, for they are doing as much
damage with it as the first day we started in," said
the officer addressed.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XII<br />
<span class="small">FINDING THE ENEMY'S BATTERY</span></h2>
</div>

<p>"I think it is a very fortunate circumstance
that we have found this range mark," said the
captain, turning to the boys. "It is a remarkable
evidence that your training has been in the right
direction. This discovery entitles you to special
mention in my report. Take the names of these
young men," he said, addressing an officer, "and
also the address, so that due credit may be given
them."</p>

<p>"Where are you staying?" asked the officer.</p>

<p>"At the main camp north of Corbie," answered
Ralph. "Colonel Winston knows us, and he has
promised to get us in the artillery."</p>

<p>"Then you really want to be put to work!"
asked the commandant.</p>

<p>"Yes; that is why we left the aviation service,
after our friend was killed," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"How would our battery suit you?" asked the
commandant with a smile.</p>

<p>"Oh, it would be just what we want," answered
Ralph quickly. "We can do anything; if you'll
only try us."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span></p>

<p>"Then come along and help us tomorrow when
we alter our range," said the commandant.</p>

<p>"Here, Frisky! come on!" said Alfred, as the
animal was still pawing and sniffing around. "I
suppose he can go along, too, may he?"</p>

<p>The group was immensely amused at the request.
"We might make him the mascot of the
battery," said one of them.</p>

<p>As they were walking up the hill, one of the
great guns resounded, soon followed by another
crash.</p>

<p>"How long do you keep it up at a time?" asked
Alfred.</p>

<p>"Usually an hour; but I presume there will be
no more firing after we reach the battery. The
revelations of that stone will necessitate some revision
and calculation," was the answer.</p>

<p>Arriving at the dug-outs, the first care of the
commandant was to give orders for the housing
of the boys, and Frisky was provided with a cozy
place.</p>

<p>"I suppose he'll go back to the cottage this evening
or tomorrow. The old man said that he returned
to the house every day," said Ralph.</p>

<p>There was no thought now of going back to the
camp. Their belongings, what few they had, were
still there, and the thing uppermost in their minds,
after they were comfortably settled, was to devise
a way to have them sent over.</p>

<p>"Why not write a letter to Capt. Rose, and ask
him to see that they are packed up and sent to
us?" proposed Alfred.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span></p>

<p>A letter was, therefore, prepared, setting forth
their adventures briefly, in which their compliments
were sent to Col. Winston, with the request
that their things should be forwarded.</p>

<p>"How are we to have the things directed?"
queried Ralph.</p>

<p>"I will ask one of the men," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Going to have your things sent here, eh?" replied
the man. "Just address Royal Artillery,
Hill 406; it will come all right."</p>

<p>"When will this go out?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Tomorrow forenoon," was the reply.</p>

<p>The evening meal was hugely enjoyed by the
boys, for they had had a strenuous day. It was
the first time in months that they were served
roast beef,&mdash;the Britisher's dish, and while the
hospitals are always provided with the best-cooked
food, and many dainties, such as invalids relish,
the artillery branch of the service is usually served
with the most substantial and regular meals. The
infantry always has plenty, but the difficulty is
that the poor fellows in the front line can get their
food, while a battle is in progress, only at irregular
intervals.</p>

<p>Located, as they were, near the top of a hill, far
from the enemy, having no fear of unexpected assaults,
and only occasionally disturbed by the
great shells which sometimes search them out, the
artilleryman can dine in comfort on food well
cooked in a finely arranged kitchen, usually presided
over by a competent chef.</p>

<p>That was why the boys enjoyed the meal, or one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
of the reasons; the other being, undoubtedly, the
normal hunger which seems to come to all boys
who are in an active and growing stage.</p>

<p>They had potatoes, turnips and salad, and even
fruit, as well as tea, although coffee was also
served to those who called for it.</p>

<p>"Well! if they don't have real apple pie!" said
Alfred, as the dishes were removed for the final
course.</p>

<p>"Tarts! my boy! Tarts!" interjected Alfred's
neighbor.</p>

<p>"Well, we call them pies," explained Ralph.
"When they have a crust on top they are pies, and
the little things without any tops are tarts."</p>

<p>This started a laugh, followed by the usual discussion
on the different terms used by various
people.</p>

<p>"You may be the right one after all," said Alfred.
"We lived in England for a time, and I
remember once going into a grocery with father
who wanted to get some fruit. He asked for a
can of peaches, and the clerk replied: 'Ah! you
mean tinned peaches!'</p>

<p>"Yes; that was correct," said the man.</p>

<p>"The clerk handed down the article, and the
label on the outside said: 'American Canning Co.'
I always supposed the goods were canned, not
tinned," replied Ralph, laughing.</p>

<p>"My word! I never thought of that before! I
dare say you may be right," was the reply.</p>

<p>It was evident from the activity in the camp the
next morning that something unusual was at hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
At eight o 'clock Ralph burst into the lean-to, which
extended out from the hole-in-the-ground shelter,
which they called the boudoir, with the startling
information that two aeroplanes were hovering
about.</p>

<p>"What! are they Germans?" asked Alfred, as
he leaped up.</p>

<p>"No, indeed; one is a Farman, and the other is
a Bruegot: I imagine from that there will be some
special observation work on hand," answered
Ralph, as they moved out of the shadow of the
trees, so as to get a good view of them.</p>

<p>"Why are they settling down on that side of the
hill?" asked Alfred, as an officer appeared.</p>

<p>"That is the only available landing place near
by," was the answer.</p>

<p>"Do they come over frequently?" It was Ralph
who spoke.</p>

<p>"This is the first time since I have been here,"
replied the officer. "But we are going to change
the range today," he continued, "and we need the
flyers to report results."</p>

<p>"I am glad of that," replied Alfred.</p>

<p>"The commandant is very agreeably surprised
at your discovery, and is hoping for good results,"
he said, as he moved away.</p>

<p>"Let's go over to headquarters," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Why not go down and take a look at the machines?"
suggested Alfred.</p>

<p>"That would be a good idea," responded Ralph,
as he led the way.</p>

<p>Just then an officer hurriedly marched across<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
the open space behind the guns, and, passing the
guard line, moved down the hill to the left. The
boys followed.</p>

<p>"I suppose that's where he is going," remarked
Alfred.</p>

<p>The road made a slight turn at a point below the
guard line, and one of the machines was just
sighted as it passed the brow of the hill and descended
the valley.</p>

<p>"Hurry up! there it is!" remarked Ralph.</p>

<p>"There is the other machine," said Alfred, as
he stopped to gaze to the east.</p>

<p>A ten minutes' walk brought them close to the
plateau, on which the machines had landed. They
followed the officer and were soon alongside the
Farman.</p>

<p>One of the men arose from his seat in the machine,
held out his hand toward the boys, and
shouted: "What are you doing here?"</p>

<p>The boys sprang forward, jumped on the fuselage
and extended their hands.</p>

<p>"Lieutenant Winston! sure enough!" said
Ralph.</p>

<p>"No! Captain!" corrected Alfred.</p>

<p>"How do you do, Captain?" said Ralph. "I
am so glad to see you. You came at the right
time."</p>

<p>"Well, it seems you always come at the right
time, too," replied the captain, as he reached forward
with both hands to welcome them.</p>

<p>The officer now approached and saluted.</p>

<p>"We got our orders this morning to report here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
for special duty," said the captain. "What is up
now? Have the Germans been doing you up?"</p>

<p>"Oh, no! Just getting ready to perform that
service on them, thanks to the boys," replied the
officer, laughing and pointing to them.</p>

<p>"Well, that is interesting; if it hadn't been for
these boys I would not have had the pleasure of reporting
to you this morning," answered the captain.</p>

<p>"That is certainly surprising news, and the telling
of it will please the colonel," said the officer.</p>

<p>The boys were now introduced to Lieutenant
Martin, who occupied the seat of observer in the
other machine. Together the five ascended the hill
and reported to the colonel commanding the batteries
on the crest.</p>

<p>The captain and lieutenant entered the commandant's
office, while the boys remained outside
with the officers.</p>

<p>In a few moments an orderly appeared and
notified the boys that the commandant required
their presence. As they entered the door the commandant
met them with a pleasant smile.</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear about you from the captain.
Why didn't you tell me you were friends of the
captain here and of Colonel Winston at the
camp?" asked the commandant.</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose we had too much else to think
about, sir," replied Alfred.</p>

<p>"It is very interesting," continued the commandant.
"But we must proceed to business.
These boys made a remarkable discovery yesterday;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
I am about to make a test of the information
we gained through them, and we need your eyes
to help us out."</p>

<p>"No wonder the boys were entitled to decorations!"
said the captain, looking at the boys with
ill-concealed admiration.</p>

<p>"Decorations?" almost shouted the commander.
"Where are they?" he asked the boys.</p>

<p>"Why, we have them in our pockets," said
Ralph, amused at the allusion to them.</p>

<p>Alfred drew out his and dangled it. The officers
laughed heartily, as the commandant said: "Well,
most men would have had them on show all the
time."</p>

<p>"Our engineers have made these charts for your
guidance," continued the commandant. "We
have peppered that section, marked 29, for the
past week, but the big guns they have somewhere
in that section are just as lively as ever. This
sketch shows the bench marks that the boys discovered
yesterday on the side of the hill. Our observation
of it seemed to confirm the theory of the
boys that these arrows pointed to the hidden batteries.
We want your aid to ascertain whether or
not they are really there, and if you will commence
your observation over that section, the guns will
begin as soon as we receive your signals."</p>

<p>The preliminaries having been all arranged, and
the signals understood so that there would be no
errors, the captain and lieutenant at once proceeded
down the hill. Fifteen minutes thereafter
the two machines began to circle overhead, and,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
having reached the predetermined height, began
the flight southeast to reach the depression to the
left of the hill behind the German lines.</p>

<p>The two machines soon found themselves antagonized
by several enemy ships, but still the flights
were made back and forth. With field glasses it
could plainly be seen that there was a fight on
hand, which increased their anxiety more and
more as two more German machines came up from
the north.</p>

<p>"That begins to look a little serious for our
boys," said Ralph, walking back and forth nervously.</p>

<p>"That makes six machines after them," said
Alfred. "But what is that over there?" continued
Alfred, as he pointed to the south. "Look at them,
Ralph! Are they our machines?"</p>

<p>"Yes! yes! four, five, six, eight; some of them
Sopwiths; now there'll be some fun," cried Ralph
enthusiastically.</p>

<p>"They'll be there in ten minutes," said Alfred.
"They are going up, up; that was Lieutenant's
favorite trick; they are doing that to frighten the
German aeroplanes away from Captain Winston."</p>

<p>"And it's succeeding, too," replied Ralph.
"One of the machines is coming this way; no, it's
not the lieutenant, so it must be Captain Winston."</p>

<p>"Order the men to stand at attention," shouted
the commandant. "Are they all ready?" he
asked after a moment.</p>

<p>"They are ready for the order."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span></p>

<p>"The captain has just signaled with two puffs."</p>

<p>"Trial range!" ordered the commandant.
"Boom! boom!" replied two of the monsters in
reply.</p>

<p>The machine turned, and speeded away toward
the hill beyond.</p>

<p>"Where are the German ships now?" asked the
commandant.</p>

<p>"Nowhere in sight," replied Ralph.</p>

<p>"The other machine must be coming this way,"
sang out Alfred. "Three puffs to the right, followed
by another one."</p>

<p>"One degree to the right!" observed the chief
gunner. This order was imparted to the gun
crews.</p>

<p>Thus the battle continued for two hours, while
the great guns on the hill searched every nook and
corner, if there was one, in the depression toward
which the arrow on the bench mark pointed.</p>

<p>The machines were returning. It would be impossible
for the aviators and observers to continue
the arduous duty for a much greater length
of time, and as the guns were landing the great
shells within the area which it was intended to
search out, the new duty would call them the next
day.</p>

<p>The guns didn't cease to roar until late that
evening. Three great motor vans were constantly
moving up and down the hill, bringing the immense
shells, and it was a fascinating game to see
the manner in which they were handled after they
left the vans.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span></p>

<p>Directly behind the row of guns was a narrow-gauge
railway, with a return switch, or siding.
Two metal trucks were employed, each truck having
a rack which carried six shells which were
loaded crosswise. Below the rack was a sort of
box, also of metal. Behind each gun was a track,
which led to the main railway, and on this short
branch was a truck adapted to hold a single shell.</p>


<div class="figcenter">
  <img src="images/i_138.jpg" alt="Hill_203" />
  <div class="caption">
    <span class="small"><i>Arrangement of Guns on Hill 203</i></span>
  </div>
</div>


<p>A stationary rack was alongside of the track
adjacent the branch track, capable of holding three
shells, so that this rack would temporarily hold
the shells as they were unloaded from the carrying
truck. As the truck on the main line unloaded its
freight, the assistants would throw the cartridge,
or the rear part of a fired shell, into the box beneath
the racks, and it was thus conveyed back to
the vans. The latter would be loaded and conveyed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
down the hill to be transported back to the
munition factories.</p>

<p>The loading operation of the huge shells was
also interesting, for it must be remembered that
some of the missiles weigh nearly a ton. After the
tremendous rebound of the gun, the breech block
was opened, the opening mechanism being so arranged
that the cartridge shell would be extracted
automatically, thus preparing the gun for the next
shell.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span class="small">THE MYSTERIOUS FIGURES ON THE RANGE FINDER</span></h2>
</div>

<p>All in the battery arose the next morning with
an air of expectancy on their countenances, and
this was particularly marked in the demeanor of
the boys. Captain Winston was at the camp all
night, and the probable result of the cannonading
was the all-important topic.</p>

<p>"Do you think, Captain, that we wiped out the
big battery over there yesterday?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"That is the problem uppermost in my mind,"
replied the captain. "It was impossible for me
to spot any location in that depression, which
could conceal the guns, although, of course, as my
observations were not less than a mile from the
earth, it is rather indefinite."</p>

<p>"Do you think they will have another try at it
today?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"I understand not," was his reply.</p>

<p>"Then what will be done really to find out?"
asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"That is what we are now considering," said
the lieutenant. "I do not know what suggestion
to make. We have gone over the bench mark and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
are sure that it portends something, but what it is
impossible to figure out."</p>

<p>During all this conversation it must not be understood
that the guns were silent. It was the
custom to change the angle and sweep of the guns
continually during these desultory rounds, the annoying
thing being that there was no positive way
of determining the effect of shots which landed
three and four miles away.</p>

<p>"The commandant wishes to see you," said an
orderly, addressing the captain.</p>

<p>Directly west of the hill, within the German
lines just referred to, and, probably, three miles
distant, was a spur of the railroad which led from
the main camp ten miles in the rear. For more
than two weeks it had been impossible for the British
forces to use that road as some hidden battery
of Germans, having the exact range, could rake it
with heavy shells, and it was, consequently, torn
up after each repair trip.</p>

<p>It was generally used in the night to transport
troops and provisions, but even that was too unsafe.
All the supplies, therefore, for a mile of
trenches, had to be conveyed through a section
over which there were no roads, by vans, and the
entire road was literally lined with machines
which were mired. To wipe out the battery or batteries
which were doing such execution, was the
problem before our battery on the hill.</p>

<p>Furthermore, it must be understood that before
an advance could be made, with any degree of success,
the location of that battery must be found.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
Once discovered, the English knew that it would
be only a matter of hours before it would be wiped
off the face of the earth. The great eight-inch
guns were there for that purpose.</p>

<p>"I have some interesting news for you," said
the captain, as he appeared at the door.</p>

<p>"What is it?" asked the lieutenant.</p>

<p>"The branch railroad was actually pulverized
last night," he replied.</p>

<p>Ralph dropped back and slowly shook his head.
"I guess," he said, "the arrow means something
else."</p>

<p>It was a great blow to all of them.</p>

<p>"Have you the sketch of the chart with you?"</p>

<p>The captain took it out of his pocket with a listless
air.</p>

<p>"I am very much disappointed," he said. "If it
is in that hollow I do not see how they could possibly
be in condition to use the guns during the
night. We could not see a trace of tracks to convey
the ammunition to the guns at that place if
any were there, and our shots fell all over the hollow
back for a mile beyond the range indicated
on the stone."</p>

<p>Alfred was intently examining the chart. "The
commandant was puzzled at the figures 300, 200
and 60, which are in the circles below the arrows.
Isn't it likely that they are there for some purpose?"
asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Unquestionably," replied the lieutenant.
"Those figures may be the key to the whole reading."</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>"I'll tell you what I think," said Ralph, rising
and walking about excitedly. "I have an idea
about that 300. Do you know, Captain, how far it
is from the depression where the arrow points to,
to the top of the hill?"</p>

<p>"Not definitely; it might be about 450 or 500
feet; possibly more. But why do you ask?" remarked
the captain.</p>

<p>"Well, here is the arrow, with the 5 at the head
of it, on the right side of the line that runs east
and west; and below the cross line and also on the
right side is the number 300. Now, my idea is,
that if the battery is not found at the place where
the arrow points, it must be 300 meters to the
right side of the direction given by the arrow," answered
Ralph.</p>

<p>The captain arose with just as much enthusiasm
in his action. "I believe you have struck it, we
must consult the commandant; come on," and he
led the way with quickened steps.</p>

<p>"Reading the chart?" said the commandant,
with a twinkle in his eye, as the company entered,
and the captain pointed to the chart, while the
amused smile on the faces of the others plainly indicated
that something unusual had taken place.</p>

<p>"It seems to me Ralph has struck it," said the
captain.</p>

<p>The commandant reached for the chart. "Do
you mean the strange figures in the circle?" he
asked.</p>

<p>"Yes; I felt sure those figures were the keys;
Ralph seems to have given a turn to a key that has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
possibilities in it; we all know the battery is not
in that depression. Might it not be 300 meters to
the right of the direction which the arrow indicates?"
asked the captain.</p>

<p>The commandant gazed at the chart, and with
it in his hand paced the floor, stopping occasionally
to fix some feature in his mind.</p>

<p>"If you will pardon me," said Ralph, "it does
not seem to me that the 300 has anything to do
with the circle, but that its position on the right of
the east and west line means something."</p>

<p>"That is the very thing I had in my mind this
moment," responded the commandant. "It is
most probable that such is the case. But stop;
might that not be feet, eh, Captain?"</p>

<p>"Not at all likely, for that would land us somewhere
near the top of the hill, and I think you
have plowed up that region pretty thoroughly,"
answered the captain.</p>

<p>"Enough; if that battery isn't 300 meters to the
right then we must make another guess. Get your
ranges for 300 meters, and we'll pepper them tomorrow,"
said the captain in a decisive tone.
"Before you go, boys, I want to say that you are
certainly deserving of praise for your methods of
observation; it is exercised in a direction that
might be observed with profit by many others."</p>

<p>The boys accompanied the captain and lieutenant
to the temporary shed on the plateau next
morning, after the final interview had taken place
with the commandant.</p>

<p>"The sight of the machines here almost makes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
me feel as though I ought to get back in the aviation
service," said Alfred, as he walked around
the machine and examined the new improvements
that had been added since they were in that branch
of the army.</p>

<p>Promptly at eight o'clock the engines started
and the machines began their flight. It was a
beautiful sight to see them sail across the sunlit
fields of France, for it was a lovely morning.</p>

<p>"Ah! this will be a fine day to make observations,"
said the commandant, as the boys reached
headquarters. "I should like to have you here to
note the movement of the machines during their
manoeuvers," he said, addressing the boys.</p>

<p>Both Ralph and Alfred were accordingly supplied
with strong field glasses to aid them in noting
the events which would take place. The guns were
silent as no orders had been issued for the resumption
of the bombardment.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the airplanes had reached the zone
directly above the questionable ground. They
could be seen plainly by the boys, circling to and
fro over the hill and to the south. In a half hour
one of the machines rapidly ascended and started
for the English lines.</p>

<p>"Here she comes," said Ralph. "One of them
is on the way."</p>

<p>"But where is the other one? I haven't noticed
it since they disappeared beyond the clouds," remarked
Alfred.</p>

<p>The airplane grew larger, and a single puff appeared.
The order was given for the first round,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
and the hill shook with the reverberations. The
airplane now circled around, while the guns kept
booming, and after the first circle it flew back
above the suspected area. Then it disappeared.</p>

<p>The faintest trace of smoke appeared on top
of the hill. The commandant saw it. "I suspect,"
he said, "that they have located some anti-airship
guns on that point."</p>

<p>"Yes, we noticed that yesterday," said Ralph.</p>

<p>Suddenly, one of the airplanes came out of the
gray cloud and Alfred was quick to announce the
fact.</p>

<p>"But why do we not get any signals from
them?" asked the commandant.</p>

<p>"The one coming this way is signaling," said
Ralph. "Two puffs, so far, but it is very misty;
yes, two puffs, and two more, one above the ship
follows it. Why, we must be firing beyond the
mark."</p>

<p>The gunners were directed to alter the range.</p>

<p>After a half dozen rounds the commandant
asked: "Do the signals confirm the range?"</p>

<p>"Not yet,&mdash;wait a moment,&mdash;I can see a single
puff only; it is above the machine; the gunners
are all right; there, another puff to the left; if the
gunners will aim a little more to the left they will
be all right," said Alfred, as rapidly as he could
utter the words.</p>

<p>"That machine acts queerly," said Ralph.
"What do you make out? Is it the Farman machine?"</p>

<p>"It looks like it," said Alfred. After a few moments'<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
observation he added: "Yes, that is Captain
Winston's machine. It seems as though he
were making a dive. I can't understand it."</p>

<p>"He seems to be coming this way," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes; but he is going down for all he is worth,"
said Alfred.</p>

<p>It was now evident that the Farman had been
hit. It moved through the air like a drunken man,
and several times it dove down headlong, only to
catch itself and momentarily sail upward again.</p>

<p>"If he can only keep that up for another mile
he will be all right," said Ralph, as his gaze was
fixed intently on the moving object. The suspense
was intense for a few minutes.</p>

<p>"Isn't that too bad!" said Alfred, as he removed
the glasses from his eyes. "He's gone!
he's gone!" he added in great excitement.</p>

<p>"The machine is now going at a terrific rate of
speed. I know what that means," sadly remarked
Ralph.</p>

<p>"I believe the captain's all right, after all,"
shouted Alfred, somewhat cheered up, after he
again had focused the glasses.</p>

<p>"Why do you think so?" queried Ralph.</p>

<p>"Because he has again righted the machine;
that shows he's all right," responded Alfred.</p>

<p>The machine was now less than a thousand feet
from the earth, and was safe within the English
lines. Down, down it went, sometimes plunging
almost vertically, then again staggering from side
to side.</p>

<p>"He's almost down now," said Ralph. "Poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
fellow; I wish we could go over and see him."</p>

<p>"Take one of the vans, and present the order
at the village," said the commandant. "This will
give you permission to requisition any conveyance."</p>

<p>The boys fairly flew out of the commandant's
office. They sprang into the first motor van which
was rounding the corner, Ralph holding up the slip
with the red gun on the corner. The man in
charge nodded his head in reply.</p>

<p>"Hot work," he remarked. "Any news up
there?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Nothing in particular," said Alfred. "We
saw one of our machines go down, and are going
over to see if he is all right."</p>

<p>"Good luck to you. Hope he is all right."</p>

<p>"Well, that beats me," shouted one of the helpers,
seated on the rear end of the van.</p>

<p>"What's that?" questioned Ralph.</p>

<p>"Look at the pup!" replied the man.</p>

<p>"Say, Mister, hold up until I get the dog," cried
Alfred.</p>

<p>Frisky had seen the attempt of the boys to steal
away. He was following the van at top speed.</p>

<p>"Come on Frisky! Forgot all about you!
Here, take hold of him," directed Alfred, as he
handed up the animal.</p>

<p>"Where did you get him?" asked the chauffeur.</p>

<p>"He's our war relic. Used to live at the
wrecked cottage at the turn of the road; you know,
the place down below," said Ralph.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span></p>

<p>The chauffeur rushed the van down and out
along the road leading to the village.</p>

<p>"Which way are you going?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Toward the big hill across the river. He came
down in that direction," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"But you're not going to walk there, are you?"
he queried.</p>

<p>"Not if we can find any other way," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"Then let me advise you; there's a fellow on
the side street that leads past the old hotel, who
has some bicycles. You might borrow a couple,"
responded the chauffeur.</p>

<p>"The suggestion is a good one; thank you," replied
Alfred.</p>

<p>They were fortunate in finding the very articles
needed. "How much for these two machines for
two hours?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Six francs; but you must deposit the value of
the machines," replied the man.</p>

<p>"Then we'll requisition them," said Alfred,
drawing the slip out of his pocket and presenting
it to the astonished man.</p>

<p>He quickly handed back the slip, as he remarked:
"You may take the machines."</p>

<p>Alfred then handed him the six francs, and the
boys, mounting the wheels, were soon rapidly
speeding out the same avenue on which they were
halted so unceremoniously two days before.
Frisky was at their heels, delighted, no doubt, at
the outing. The guard line being reached, Alfred
drew out the slip, as he remarked:</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span></p>

<p>"I suppose we can get through this time?"</p>

<p>"Certainly," replied the guard, and then noticing
the uniforms they wore, he added: "Who was
it that came down a half hour ago?"</p>

<p>"Captain Winston," replied Ralph. "We are
anxious to know whether he is all right."</p>

<p>"I hear he is pretty badly mashed up," remarked
the guard as the boys again mounted their
wheels. "Take the first road to the right after
passing the white cottage," he shouted.</p>

<p>The road led down an incline, and they could
see the flat country beyond. As they proceeded the
road grew worse and worse. The tall trees on
both sides of the road had prevented the sun from
drying up the way properly, but, probably, that
didn't matter much, as it was evident that the
horses and few vehicles which passed over it
would have kept it in a bad condition at the best.</p>

<p>This road, which was between the first and fifth
line trenches, had not been repaired since that section
was taken from the Germans. They were at
this time less than a mile from the first trenches,
and, after passing the white house, they turned
to the right.</p>

<p>"Look at the fellows running across the second
field," shouted Ralph. "I suppose there is where
he landed."</p>

<p>At the eastern side of the meadow adjoining
the one on which they noticed the soldiers running,
was a fringe of tall trees. Near by, groups
of men were visible, and as they neared the place
they saw an object high in the trees.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span></p>

<p>"Is that the machine hung up between the two
trees?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"It looks very much like it," responded Ralph.
"Yes; that is the tail and one of the wings, sure."</p>

<p>It was a struggle to get across the miry field,
but they finally arrived. The Red Cross people,
who were already there, were rendering first aid
to the captain, who was lying on his side, his face
pale, and one of his bared arms covered with blood.</p>

<p>"How is he, Doctor?" asked Ralph, as he
sprang from his wheel and leaned over.</p>

<p>The doctor, without looking up, answered: "A
very bad fall; internal injuries; we may know
more in a few minutes."</p>

<p>"Why, that's Doctor Walker," said Alfred.</p>

<p>The physician quickly looked up at the mention
of his name.</p>

<p>"This is a strange place to find you boys," he
remarked with a welcoming smile.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span class="small">CAUGHT IN A TERRIFIC DRIVE</span></h2>
</div>

<p>"Did he land in that tree?" asked Ralph, addressing
a bystander.</p>

<p>"Yes, the machine seemed to be pretty badly
riddled, and became unmanageable long before he
reached the tree; but he went into it at a smashing
speed. The officer was thrown out and shot
down into that small tree, which broke the fall.
If it hadn't been for that he would have been
mashed to flinders," was the response.</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter the captain showed signs of
recovering consciousness. He raised the uninjured
arm, and soon opened his eyes. He glanced
at the boys, but did not seem to recognize them.</p>

<p>"He seems to be very much better," said the
doctor. "He is bruised up about the same as you
were when you were brought to the hospital at
Cortier," he said, addressing Ralph.</p>

<p>After a wait of half an hour more, the doctor
announced that the patient could be moved, and
he was accordingly carried to the van and comfortably
fixed on the hammock within.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span></p>

<p>"So you knew the captain?" inquired the doctor.</p>

<p>"Yes; we happened to be crossing the aviation
grounds at Dunkirk, at a time when the captain
was aloft, and some part of the machine broke.
He had a bad fall, and we were, fortunately, close
at hand and helped to rescue him from under the
machine," said Alfred.</p>

<p>The captain opened his eyes; he tried to smile,
but the attempt died away. Then he seemed to
make another effort, and this time succeeded.</p>

<p>"You were right," said the captain in a weak
voice. "We found it; report to the colonel. The
battery must have wiped them out by this time."</p>

<p>He closed his eyes and was silent for a time. It
seemed as though he actually dropped off into a
sound sleep.</p>

<p>"What does he mean? Do you know what he
is talking about?" asked the doctor, turning to the
boys.</p>

<p>The patient's eyelids began to quiver, and the
boys quietly nodded their heads. "That was a
corker!" continued the captain. "Tell the colonel,
by all means."</p>

<p>"What colonel does he mean?" asked Alfred.
"The colonel commanding the battery, or his
brother?"</p>

<p>"Both, of course," suggested Ralph.</p>

<p>The van started, the boys mounting their wheels
and following.</p>

<p>"We are going back to the base camp, and put
him in the hospital there," said the doctor.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>

<p>"That is where his brother, the colonel, is in
command," remarked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes," answered the doctor.</p>

<p>During the foregoing period of time there was
not a moment when the firing on both sides of the
lines had ceased. As the boys turned to the right
to reach the road, they saw hundreds of soldiers
rushing across to reach the third line, and it
seemed as though the firing had grown heavier
than when they had come out the road an hour
before.</p>

<p>"Something unusual is going on," remarked
Ralph. "Why are they gathering the machine
guns behind those trenches? That is the third
line; the second line cannot be more than three
hundred yards behind us."</p>

<p>They were about to turn to the east and west
road, when the most intense shell fire was opened
up on their right.</p>

<p>"Get under cover quickly!" shouted a voice.</p>

<p>The boys turned, but were unable to detect the
speaker. "I suppose we must obey," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Hide? But where?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"Wheel down to the hollow," cried Ralph.</p>

<p>The hollow was reached, and in their eagerness
they almost fell into the ditch. It was the third
line, filled with men ready to do their duty.
Frisky tumbled in with a yelp and a growl.</p>

<p>"What's the matter?" asked Ralph, as he
picked himself up from the bottom of the trench.</p>

<p>"The Germans are making a counter attack over
a front of a mile," was the reply of the corporal.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span></p>

<p>"Then we are just in time," said Alfred. "Any
guns handy?"</p>

<p>The men looked amused at the request. "Well,
that's no laughing matter," said Ralph. "We're
not here for the fun of the thing."</p>

<p>This prompt answer was an additional cause for
merriment, in which both boys joined.</p>

<p>Crack! crack! crack! R-r-r-r-r-r. The machine
guns began to speak. The men on each side became
subdued, and their faces exhibited set expressions,
for they knew that the voices of the machine
gun meant an enemy near at hand.</p>

<p>At a little alcove, cut in the side of the trench,
was an orderly with a telephone transmitter in his
hand. The corporal leaned over to catch his
words, for the din was now intense.</p>

<p>"The Germans have taken the first line and are
moving the 22d back on the Corbeville road. The
third line must hold them until the additional guns
are brought up. We shall counter attack in the
next section to the south." Such were, in part, the
orders and instructions which the operator imparted
to the corporal.</p>

<p>"Why, this is the Corbeville road," said Ralph
in a tremor of excitement.</p>

<p>"Then we are in for it this time," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"You may have the guns," said the orderly, as
the boys stood before him and repeated the request.</p>

<p>There was no time to give orders as to the positions
they were to take. Almost instantly there
arose a column of troops three hundred feet ahead<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
and every man, without an order, leveled his gun
across the parapet above the trench and fired as
fast as the levers of the guns could be manipulated.</p>

<p>"Fire deliberately!" said the corporal, as he
walked along the short stretch of the ditch directly
under his command.</p>

<p>The moment the boys began to fire they seemed
to be animated with an entirely different feeling.
The tremor and excitement had gone, and they
were keyed up to the most extreme earnestness.
The dark, greyish line on the other side of the field
kept moving toward them, but gaps in the ranks
were plainly seen. Would they dare charge all the
way up to the trench?</p>

<p>They fired and fired and fired, until their shoulders
began to ache; then something happened. No
more Germans were in sight. What had become
of them?</p>

<p>"They are digging in," said the corporal. "Get
ready, boys."</p>

<p>"I wonder what that means?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"Why, don't you see the Germans have stopped
and are digging trenches, and the corporal is going
to order a charge to drive them out?" answered
Alfred.</p>

<p>The order came sooner than expected. "Ready!
Forward! Open order!" shouted the corporal,
and he was the first to scramble out of the ditch.</p>

<p>There was no firing now on the part of the British,
for they were too busily engaged in springing
forward and avoiding the obstructions which beset<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
them every foot of the way. If the hidden Germans
were firing at them they were not aware of
it, for the din was too great to distinguish anything.
The singular thing, to the boys, however,
was the fact that at almost every step, some one
would halt and drop down.</p>

<p>"Halt! Down!" cried a voice. Suddenly the
line was prone on the ground. The man between
the boys thrust his bayonet into the sod and loosened
it, and with his hands quickly built a small
parapet in front of him. Looking about they saw
others do the same.</p>

<p>"Is that called digging in?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"That's one way," replied the soldier. The sod
was rolled up and pushed from him, and he dragged
himself forward until his body rested in the
shallow trench thus made, while the roll of sod
in front became, in reality, a protection.</p>

<p>"Ready to repel!" shouted the corporal.</p>

<p>They now understood; for no sooner had the
words left the corporal's lips than the Germans
sprang forward. Every gun must have cracked
at the same time, and the aim was evidently careful,
for their first volley caused the line to halt
and waver.</p>

<p>"At them, boys! Forward on the run!" fairly
shrieked the corporal. Frisky was the first one
out of the trench.</p>

<p>Every man was on his feet. As the boys rose
to follow they happened to glance back for the first
time. The sight that met them created the greatest
enthusiasm and confidence, for, climbing out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
of the very trenches they had occupied twenty minutes
before, were hundreds of khaki-clad veterans,&mdash;the
reserves, who had come up to support the
counter attack. That banished every fear, if such
a thing was lurking within them. At every step,
and whenever a favorable object came into view,
the gun would be raised and a shot or two given
by each soldier, which only slightly impeded their
forward movement.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a tremendous cheer to the
right; the boys could see hundreds of men leaping
over the brush, and stumbling across the remains
of a stone fence. The Germans were giving way,
and when the line on their right had passed the
ridge and began to rush down the little incline, the
corporal cried, "Halt!"</p>

<p>The movement of the troop cut off the only line
of retreat of the enemy in front of the position
occupied by the company the boys had engaged.
They stopped but for a moment only, when the
second order came. "Forward march!"</p>

<p>"Kamarad!" shouted several voices, as the
forms appeared through the smoke.</p>

<p>"Come forward!" came the order.</p>

<p>Instantly there rose from the ground, as if by
magic, dozens of men. They stood up with hands
upstretched, and formed themselves together in
columns. The lieutenant in charge of the British
advance stepped forward, gave a quick command,
and the men, now prisoners of war, marched forward
and were ordered to halt long enough to permit
the officer in charge to point out the detail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
which was selected to take the prisoners to the
rear.</p>

<p>The corporal looked at the boys, and they knew
that it meant their detail as well. The orderly
marched ahead, and the prisoners with the guard
began the march to the village two miles in the
rear.</p>

<p>As they were about to enter the village, Ralph
shouted to Alfred, who happened to be on the other
side of the row of prisoners: "Say, we forgot to
bring our wheels back!"</p>

<p>The remark brought forth the first ripple of
laughter in that party. It was such an unexpected
thing. Who cared about a couple of
wheels? Escorting prisoners of war to the detention
camp was certainly of more importance
than recovering a pair of bicycles.</p>

<p>"Never mind the wheels," replied Alfred. "We
have better business to attend to just now."</p>

<p>The German lieutenant, who understood the language,
enjoyed the remarks quite as much as the
guards, for he laughed in spite of the disaster to
his troops. Thereupon he and Alfred had quite
a conversation on the way.</p>

<p>The village was entered and passed. Frisky
now darted from one side of the column to the
other and yelped his approval.</p>

<p>"You ought to be ashamed of yourself, Frisky,
making fun of these poor fellows," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"No, he oughtn't to!" shouted Ralph, in reply,
and the smile faded from the face of the German
lieutenant.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span></p>

<p>The names of the soldiers and officers were
taken down, their clothing searched, and one by
one they passed into the enclosure to remain until
the end of the war, unless exchanged.</p>

<p>"I suppose we are out of a job now," said
Ralph to the corporal. "To whom shall we turn
over the guns?"</p>

<p>The corporal designated two soldiers to take the
guns and cartridge belts. "Before you go, just
give me your name and the detachment to which
you belong," he said.</p>

<p>"Never mind about that," said Alfred. "It
isn't necessary," he added.</p>

<p>"Yes, it is part of my duty; I must include it
in my report."</p>

<p>While speaking, Alfred noticed the orderly belonging
to the battery approaching. He advanced
and handed an envelope to him. Alfred hurriedly
opened it.</p>

<p>"The commandant on the hill desires your presence
at the battery without delay," said the communication.</p>

<p>"All right! We are ready! Come on, Frisky,"
said Ralph.</p>

<p>"The colonel's machine is outside waiting for
you," said the orderly.</p>

<p>"Well, how did you know we were here?" asked
Alfred.</p>

<p>"Colonel Winston, whose machine will take us
up the hill, arrived a quarter of an hour ago, with
some friends of yours, and when he learned you
were not here, sent me down with orders to hunt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
you up. I had no idea you came in with the prisoners,
and just stepped over out of curiosity to
have a look at them, and thus, fortunately, found
you," said the orderly.</p>

<p>"Well, who can our friends be that called with
Colonel Winston?" asked Ralph.</p>

<p>"I really don't know," replied the orderly.</p>

<p>"And, by the way, where is Captain Winston?
Does Colonel Winston know about the accident to
his brother?" asked Alfred.</p>

<p>"I presume that is what brought him over so
quickly, for the accident, as you know, happened
less than three hours ago," replied the orderly.</p>

<p>The motor car was not long in making the trip
to the top of the hill. When they passed the ruins
of the cottage, Frisky jumped up onto the seat,
gave a few distinct yelps, and then settled back
into the seat beside Alfred. It is singular that
from the time he attached himself to the boys,
there seemed to be no desire in his mind to return
to his old home.</p>

<p>"Go direct to the commandant's quarters," said
the orderly to the chauffeur.</p>

<p>The commandant and Colonel Winston were at
the door as the machine drove up. The boys were
out and sprang toward them.</p>

<p>"Is the captain all right, sir?" asked Alfred
hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Yes; I left him a half hour ago, very comfortable,
indeed," replied the colonel.</p>

<p>"We received the note, ordering us to come here
at once," said Ralph.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes; we want to inform you that we have
every reason to believe that 300 meters to the right
hit the spot," said the commandant.</p>

<p>"Well, we <i>know</i> it was the right spot," replied
Alfred. "The German battery there was literally
wiped out."</p>

<p>"How did you learn that?" asked the commandant
with the greatest eagerness.</p>

<p>"We learned it from Captain Winston; he told
us about it since the accident," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"I know it from another source," replied Alfred.</p>

<p>"Where? What?" asked the colonel, in astonishment.</p>

<p>"The German lieutenant whom we captured this
morning told me on the way over, that of the six
guns they had south of the hill there wasn't
enough left to gather up, and that was the main
reason why they started the drive that failed so
miserably," said Alfred.</p>

<p>"But the orderly said some friends were up
here to see us," said Ralph.</p>

<p>"Yes; I brought them over with me; they were
afraid you'd get into more trouble," said the colonel,
as he opened a door leading into an adjoining
room.</p>

<p>Ralph stepped forward with some curiosity on
his countenance. He could not speak as his
mother appeared and rushed toward him.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're not my boy any more," she sobbed,
as she embraced him and held him at arm's length
for a moment.</p>

                    <p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span></p>

<p>Alfred was no less astounded as his mother first
took him in her arms, and his father also put his
arms around him.</p>

<p>"What naughty boys you've been," said Alfred's
mother. "We didn't hear from you for
four months, and once we were notified that you
were dead; what a joy it is to see you again!"</p>

<p>"But how they have grown," said Ralph's
mother.</p>

<p>"But you must remember, Mother, that they are
men now," said the colonel, with a smile.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
